# Library

The library is a website application that reads text files into a template dynamically.

Both the challenge and the fun of building this library was getting to understand asychronous Javascript for the first time. Javascript waits for no one! Not even reading and writing of files!

I chose to sort the text by chapters so the user could resume reading at the chapter he/she last left off.

enjoy!
