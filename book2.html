<br><br>PETER PAN<br><br>[PETER AND WENDY]<br><br>By J. M. Barrie [James Matthew Barrie]<br><br>A Millennium Fulcrum Edition (c)1991 by Duncan Research<br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 1.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 1. PETER BREAKS THROUGH<br><br>All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow<br>up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old<br>she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with<br>it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for<br>Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you<br>remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on<br>the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always<br>know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.<br><br>Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and<br>until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady,<br>with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic<br>mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the<br>puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and<br>her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get,<br>though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.<br><br>The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been<br>boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,<br>and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who<br>took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,<br>except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and<br>in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could<br>have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a<br>passion, slamming the door.<br><br>Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him<br>but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks<br>and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,<br>and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that<br>would have made any woman respect him.<br><br>Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books<br>perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a<br>Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped<br>out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.<br>She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.<br>Darling's guesses.<br><br>Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.<br><br>For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would<br>be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was<br>frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the<br>edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,<br>while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what<br>might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece<br>of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at<br>the beginning again.<br><br>"Now don't interrupt," he would beg of her.<br><br>"I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can<br>cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine<br>and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five<br>naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that<br>moving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don't speak, my own--and<br>the pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot<br>and carry child--there, you've done it!--did I say nine nine seven? yes,<br>I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on<br>nine nine seven?"<br><br>"Of course we can, George," she cried. But she was prejudiced in Wendy's<br>favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.<br><br>"Remember mumps," he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went<br>again. "Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay<br>it will be more like thirty shillings--don't speak--measles one five,<br>German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don't waggle your<br>finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings"--and so on it went, and<br>it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,<br>with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated<br>as one.<br><br>There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower<br>squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of<br>them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by<br>their nurse.<br><br>Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a<br>passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had<br>a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children<br>drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had<br>belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had<br>always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become<br>acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her<br>spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless<br>nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their<br>mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough<br>she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her<br>charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery.<br>She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience<br>with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her<br>last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of<br>contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a<br>lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking<br>sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them<br>back into line if they strayed. On John's footer [in England soccer<br>was called football, "footer" for short] days she never once forgot his<br>sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of<br>rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the<br>nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that<br>was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior<br>social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She<br>resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they<br>did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the<br>one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's<br>hair.<br><br>No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and<br>Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the<br>neighbours talked.<br><br>He had his position in the city to consider.<br><br>Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that<br>she did not admire him. "I know she admires you tremendously, George,"<br>Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children<br>to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the<br>only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget<br>she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when<br>engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!<br>And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that<br>all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her<br>you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until<br>the coming of Peter Pan.<br><br>Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's<br>minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children<br>are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next<br>morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have<br>wandered during the day. If you could keep awake (but of course you<br>can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it<br>very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You<br>would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of<br>your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up,<br>making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as<br>if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.<br>When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with<br>which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom<br>of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your<br>prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.<br><br>I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind.<br>Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can<br>become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a<br>child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all<br>the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a<br>card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is<br>always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here<br>and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and<br>savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves<br>through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a<br>hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.<br>It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day<br>at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,<br>hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting<br>into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth<br>yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are<br>another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially<br>as nothing will stand still.<br><br>Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a<br>lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while<br>Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over<br>it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in<br>a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no<br>friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by<br>its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,<br>and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have<br>each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play<br>are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been<br>there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no<br>more.<br><br>Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most<br>compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between<br>one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by<br>day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming,<br>but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That<br>is why there are night-lights.<br><br>Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling<br>found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most<br>perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was<br>here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be<br>scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than<br>any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had<br>an oddly cocky appearance.<br><br>"Yes, he is rather cocky," Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had<br>been questioning her.<br><br>"But who is he, my pet?"<br><br>"He is Peter Pan, you know, mother."<br><br>At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her<br>childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the<br>fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he<br>went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.<br>She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and<br>full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.<br><br>"Besides," she said to Wendy, "he would be grown up by this time."<br><br>"Oh no, he isn't grown up," Wendy assured her confidently, "and he is<br>just my size." She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she<br>didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.<br><br>Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. "Mark my<br>words," he said, "it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their<br>heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it<br>will blow over."<br><br>But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.<br>Darling quite a shock.<br><br>Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.<br>For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event<br>happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead<br>father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one<br>morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been<br>found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the<br>children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy<br>said with a tolerant smile:<br><br>"I do believe it is that Peter again!"<br><br>"Whatever do you mean, Wendy?"<br><br>"It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet," Wendy said, sighing. She<br>was a tidy child.<br><br>She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter<br>sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her<br>bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she<br>didn't know how she knew, she just knew.<br><br>"What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without<br>knocking."<br><br>"I think he comes in by the window," she said.<br><br>"My love, it is three floors up."<br><br>"Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?"<br><br>It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.<br><br>Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to<br>Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.<br><br>"My child," the mother cried, "why did you not tell me of this before?"<br><br>"I forgot," said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.<br><br>Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.<br><br>But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined<br>them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they<br>did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the<br>floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She<br>rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a<br>tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty<br>feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.<br><br>Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.<br><br>But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the<br>night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be<br>said to have begun.<br><br>On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It<br>happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and<br>sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into<br>the land of sleep.<br><br>All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and<br>sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.<br><br>It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into<br>shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three<br>night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then<br>her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of<br>them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the<br>fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.<br><br>While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come<br>too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not<br>alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many<br>women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of<br>some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures<br>the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through<br>the gap.<br><br>The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming<br>the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.<br>He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which<br>darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been<br>this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.<br><br>She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once<br>that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should<br>have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He was a lovely<br>boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but<br>the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth.<br>When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 2.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 2. THE SHADOW<br><br>Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,<br>and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang<br>at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling<br>screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,<br>and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it<br>was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see<br>nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.<br><br>She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth,<br>which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had<br>closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had<br>time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.<br><br>You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was<br>quite the ordinary kind.<br><br>Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She<br>hung it out at the window, meaning "He is sure to come back for it; let<br>us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children."<br><br>But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the<br>window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the<br>house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up<br>winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his<br>head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;<br>besides, she knew exactly what he would say: "It all comes of having a<br>dog for a nurse."<br><br>She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer,<br>until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!<br><br>The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.<br>Of course it was a Friday.<br><br>"I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday," she used to say<br>afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of<br>her, holding her hand.<br><br>"No, no," Mr. Darling always said, "I am responsible for it all. I,<br>George Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA." He had had a classical<br>education.<br><br>They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every<br>detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other<br>side like the faces on a bad coinage.<br><br>"If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27," Mrs. Darling<br>said.<br><br>"If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana's bowl," said Mr.<br>Darling.<br><br>"If only I had pretended to like the medicine," was what Nana's wet eyes<br>said.<br><br>"My liking for parties, George."<br><br>"My fatal gift of humour, dearest."<br><br>"My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress."<br><br>Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the<br>thought, "It's true, it's true, they ought not to have had a dog for<br>a nurse." Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to<br>Nana's eyes.<br><br>"That fiend!" Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the echo of<br>it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the<br>right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.<br><br>They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every<br>smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,<br>so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the<br>water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.<br><br>"I won't go to bed," he had shouted, like one who still believed that he<br>had the last word on the subject, "I won't, I won't. Nana, it isn't six<br>o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell<br>you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!"<br><br>Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had<br>dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,<br>with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy's bracelet<br>on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her<br>bracelet to her mother.<br><br>She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father<br>on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying:<br><br>"I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,"<br>in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real<br>occasion.<br><br>Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.<br><br>Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the<br>birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,<br>but John said brutally that they did not want any more.<br><br>Michael had nearly cried. "Nobody wants me," he said, and of course the<br>lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.<br><br>"I do," she said, "I so want a third child."<br><br>"Boy or girl?" asked Michael, not too hopefully.<br><br>"Boy."<br><br>Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.<br>Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be<br>Michael's last night in the nursery.<br><br>They go on with their recollections.<br><br>"It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?" Mr. Darling<br>would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.<br><br>Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for<br>the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It<br>is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew<br>about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the<br>thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it<br>would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and<br>used a made-up tie.<br><br>This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the<br>crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.<br><br>"Why, what is the matter, father dear?"<br><br>"Matter!" he yelled; he really yelled. "This tie, it will not tie." He<br>became dangerously sarcastic. "Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!<br>Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my<br>neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!"<br><br>He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on<br>sternly, "I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my<br>neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner<br>to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the<br>office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the<br>streets."<br><br>Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. "Let me try, dear," she said, and<br>indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice<br>cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to<br>see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to<br>do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he<br>thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment<br>was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.<br><br>"How wildly we romped!" says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.<br><br>"Our last romp!" Mr. Darling groaned.<br><br>"O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, 'How did you get<br>to know me, mother?'"<br><br>"I remember!"<br><br>"They were rather sweet, don't you think, George?"<br><br>"And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone."<br><br>The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.<br>Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They<br>were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had<br>with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears<br>coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again<br>about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.<br><br>"George, Nana is a treasure."<br><br>"No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the<br>children as puppies."<br><br>"Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls."<br><br>"I wonder," Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, "I wonder." It was an<br>opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he<br>pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the<br>shadow.<br><br>"It is nobody I know," he said, examining it carefully, "but it does<br>look a scoundrel."<br><br>"We were still discussing it, you remember," says Mr. Darling, "when<br>Nana came in with Michael's medicine. You will never carry the bottle in<br>your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault."<br><br>Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather<br>foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking<br>that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael<br>dodged the spoon in Nana's mouth, he had said reprovingly, "Be a man,<br>Michael."<br><br>"Won't; won't!" Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to<br>get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of<br>firmness.<br><br>"Mother, don't pamper him," he called after her. "Michael, when I was<br>your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, 'Thank you, kind<br>parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.'"<br><br>He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her<br>night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, "That<br>medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?"<br><br>"Ever so much nastier," Mr. Darling said bravely, "and I would take it<br>now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the bottle."<br><br>He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the<br>top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that<br>the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.<br><br>"I know where it is, father," Wendy cried, always glad to be of service.<br>"I'll bring it," and she was off before he could stop her. Immediately<br>his spirits sank in the strangest way.<br><br>"John," he said, shuddering, "it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty,<br>sticky, sweet kind."<br><br>"It will soon be over, father," John said cheerily, and then in rushed<br>Wendy with the medicine in a glass.<br><br>"I have been as quick as I could," she panted.<br><br>"You have been wonderfully quick," her father retorted, with a<br>vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. "Michael<br>first," he said doggedly.<br><br>"Father first," said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.<br><br>"I shall be sick, you know," Mr. Darling said threateningly.<br><br>"Come on, father," said John.<br><br>"Hold your tongue, John," his father rapped out.<br><br>Wendy was quite puzzled. "I thought you took it quite easily, father."<br><br>"That is not the point," he retorted. "The point is, that there is<br>more in my glass than in Michael's spoon." His proud heart was nearly<br>bursting. "And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were with my last<br>breath; it isn't fair."<br><br>"Father, I am waiting," said Michael coldly.<br><br>"It's all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting."<br><br>"Father's a cowardly custard."<br><br>"So are you a cowardly custard."<br><br>"I'm not frightened."<br><br>"Neither am I frightened."<br><br>"Well, then, take it."<br><br>"Well, then, you take it."<br><br>Wendy had a splendid idea. "Why not both take it at the same time?"<br><br>"Certainly," said Mr. Darling. "Are you ready, Michael?"<br><br>Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,<br>but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.<br><br>There was a yell of rage from Michael, and "O father!" Wendy exclaimed.<br><br>"What do you mean by 'O father'?" Mr. Darling demanded. "Stop that row,<br>Michael. I meant to take mine, but I--I missed it."<br><br>It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if<br>they did not admire him. "Look here, all of you," he said entreatingly,<br>as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. "I have just thought of a<br>splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana's bowl, and she will<br>drink it, thinking it is milk!"<br><br>It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father's<br>sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the<br>medicine into Nana's bowl. "What fun!" he said doubtfully, and they did<br>not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.<br><br>"Nana, good dog," he said, patting her, "I have put a little milk into<br>your bowl, Nana."<br><br>Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then<br>she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the<br>great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her<br>kennel.<br><br>Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give<br>in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. "O George," she<br>said, "it's your medicine!"<br><br>"It was only a joke," he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy<br>hugged Nana. "Much good," he said bitterly, "my wearing myself to the<br>bone trying to be funny in this house."<br><br>And still Wendy hugged Nana. "That's right," he shouted. "Coddle her!<br>Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I<br>be coddled--why, why, why!"<br><br>"George," Mrs. Darling entreated him, "not so loud; the servants<br>will hear you." Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the<br>servants.<br><br>"Let them!" he answered recklessly. "Bring in the whole world. But I<br>refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer."<br><br>The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her<br>back. He felt he was a strong man again. "In vain, in vain," he cried;<br>"the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up<br>this instant."<br><br>"George, George," Mrs. Darling whispered, "remember what I told you<br>about that boy."<br><br>Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in<br>that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he<br>lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged<br>her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it.<br>It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for<br>admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched<br>father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.<br><br>In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted<br>silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and<br>John whimpered, "It is because he is chaining her up in the yard," but<br>Wendy was wiser.<br><br>"That is not Nana's unhappy bark," she said, little guessing what was<br>about to happen; "that is her bark when she smells danger."<br><br>Danger!<br><br>"Are you sure, Wendy?"<br><br>"Oh, yes."<br><br>Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.<br>She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were<br>crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place<br>there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller<br>ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made<br>her cry, "Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party to-night!"<br><br>Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he<br>asked, "Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?"<br><br>"Nothing, precious," she said; "they are the eyes a mother leaves behind<br>her to guard her children."<br><br>She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little<br>Michael flung his arms round her. "Mother," he cried, "I'm glad of you."<br>They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.<br><br>No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of<br>snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not<br>to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the street,<br>and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may<br>not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It<br>is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no<br>star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed<br>and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little<br>ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a<br>mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;<br>but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and<br>anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door<br>of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the<br>firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed<br>out:<br><br>"Now, Peter!"<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 3.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 3. COME AWAY, COME AWAY!<br><br>For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights<br>by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were<br>awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they<br>could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave<br>such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close<br>their mouths all the three went out.<br><br>There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than<br>the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been<br>in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged<br>the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a<br>light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came<br>to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand,<br>but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned<br>in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could<br>be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT.<br>[plump hourglass figure]<br><br>A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by the<br>breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried<br>Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy<br>dust.<br><br>"Tinker Bell," he called softly, after making sure that the children<br>were asleep, "Tink, where are you?" She was in a jug for the moment, and<br>liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.<br><br>"Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my<br>shadow?"<br><br>The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy<br>language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to<br>hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.<br><br>Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of<br>drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to<br>the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to the crowd. In a<br>moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he<br>had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.<br><br>If he thought at all, but I don't believe he ever thought, it was that<br>he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops<br>of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it<br>on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed<br>through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.<br><br>His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see<br>a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly<br>interested.<br><br>"Boy," she said courteously, "why are you crying?"<br><br>Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at<br>fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much<br>pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.<br><br>"What's your name?" he asked.<br><br>"Wendy Moira Angela Darling," she replied with some satisfaction. "What<br>is your name?"<br><br>"Peter Pan."<br><br>She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a<br>comparatively short name.<br><br>"Is that all?"<br><br>"Yes," he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a<br>shortish name.<br><br>"I'm so sorry," said Wendy Moira Angela.<br><br>"It doesn't matter," Peter gulped.<br><br>She asked where he lived.<br><br>"Second to the right," said Peter, "and then straight on till morning."<br><br>"What a funny address!"<br><br>Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a<br>funny address.<br><br>"No, it isn't," he said.<br><br>"I mean," Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, "is that<br>what they put on the letters?"<br><br>He wished she had not mentioned letters.<br><br>"Don't get any letters," he said contemptuously.<br><br>"But your mother gets letters?"<br><br>"Don't have a mother," he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had<br>not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated<br>persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a<br>tragedy.<br><br>"O Peter, no wonder you were crying," she said, and got out of bed and<br>ran to him.<br><br>"I wasn't crying about mothers," he said rather indignantly. "I was<br>crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't<br>crying."<br><br>"It has come off?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was<br>frightfully sorry for Peter. "How awful!" she said, but she could not<br>help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with<br>soap. How exactly like a boy!<br><br>Fortunately she knew at once what to do. "It must be sewn on," she said,<br>just a little patronisingly.<br><br>"What's sewn?" he asked.<br><br>"You're dreadfully ignorant."<br><br>"No, I'm not."<br><br>But she was exulting in his ignorance. "I shall sew it on for you, my<br>little man," she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out<br>her housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.<br><br>"I daresay it will hurt a little," she warned him.<br><br>"Oh, I shan't cry," said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he<br>had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not<br>cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little<br>creased.<br><br>"Perhaps I should have ironed it," Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,<br>boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in<br>the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss<br>to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. "How clever I<br>am!" he crowed rapturously, "oh, the cleverness of me!"<br><br>It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was<br>one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,<br>there never was a cockier boy.<br><br>But for the moment Wendy was shocked. "You conceit [braggart]," she<br>exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; "of course I did nothing!"<br><br>"You did a little," Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.<br><br>"A little!" she replied with hauteur [pride]; "if I am no use I can at<br>least withdraw," and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and<br>covered her face with the blankets.<br><br>To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this<br>failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.<br>"Wendy," he said, "don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when<br>I'm pleased with myself." Still she would not look up, though she was<br>listening eagerly. "Wendy," he continued, in a voice that no woman has<br>ever yet been able to resist, "Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty<br>boys."<br><br>Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many<br>inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.<br><br>"Do you really think so, Peter?"<br><br>"Yes, I do."<br><br>"I think it's perfectly sweet of you," she declared, "and I'll get up<br>again," and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said<br>she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she<br>meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.<br><br>"Surely you know what a kiss is?" she asked, aghast.<br><br>"I shall know when you give it to me," he replied stiffly, and not to<br>hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.<br><br>"Now," said he, "shall I give you a kiss?" and she replied with a slight<br>primness, "If you please." She made herself rather cheap by inclining<br>her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button into her<br>hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before, and<br>said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck.<br>It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to<br>save her life.<br><br>When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to<br>ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct<br>thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to<br>ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what<br>you want to be asked is Kings of England.<br><br>"I don't know," he replied uneasily, "but I am quite young." He really<br>knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a<br>venture, "Wendy, I ran away the day I was born."<br><br>Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the<br>charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he<br>could sit nearer her.<br><br>"It was because I heard father and mother," he explained in a low<br>voice, "talking about what I was to be when I became a man." He was<br>extraordinarily agitated now. "I don't want ever to be a man," he said<br>with passion. "I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So<br>I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the<br>fairies."<br><br>She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it<br>was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.<br>Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as<br>quite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,<br>for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,<br>and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding [spanking]. Still, he<br>liked them on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.<br><br>"You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its<br>laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,<br>and that was the beginning of fairies."<br><br>Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.<br><br>"And so," he went on good-naturedly, "there ought to be one fairy for<br>every boy and girl."<br><br>"Ought to be? Isn't there?"<br><br>"No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in<br>fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,'<br>there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead."<br><br>Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it<br>struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. "I can't think where<br>she has gone to," he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy's<br>heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.<br><br>"Peter," she cried, clutching him, "you don't mean to tell me that there<br>is a fairy in this room!"<br><br>"She was here just now," he said a little impatiently. "You don't hear<br>her, do you?" and they both listened.<br><br>"The only sound I hear," said Wendy, "is like a tinkle of bells."<br><br>"Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language. I think I hear her too."<br><br>The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.<br>No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of<br>gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.<br><br>"Wendy," he whispered gleefully, "I do believe I shut her up in the<br>drawer!"<br><br>He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery<br>screaming with fury. "You shouldn't say such things," Peter retorted.<br>"Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer?"<br><br>Wendy was not listening to him. "O Peter," she cried, "if she would only<br>stand still and let me see her!"<br><br>"They hardly ever stand still," he said, but for one moment Wendy saw<br>the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. "O the lovely!"<br>she cried, though Tink's face was still distorted with passion.<br><br>"Tink," said Peter amiably, "this lady says she wishes you were her<br>fairy."<br><br>Tinker Bell answered insolently.<br><br>"What does she say, Peter?"<br><br>He had to translate. "She is not very polite. She says you are a great<br>[huge] ugly girl, and that she is my fairy."<br><br>He tried to argue with Tink. "You know you can't be my fairy, Tink,<br>because I am an gentleman and you are a lady."<br><br>To this Tink replied in these words, "You silly ass," and disappeared<br>into the bathroom. "She is quite a common fairy," Peter explained<br>apologetically, "she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots<br>and kettles [tinker = tin worker]." [Similar to "cinder" plus "elle" to<br>get Cinderella]<br><br>They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him<br>with more questions.<br><br>"If you don't live in Kensington Gardens now--"<br><br>"Sometimes I do still."<br><br>"But where do you live mostly now?"<br><br>"With the lost boys."<br><br>"Who are they?"<br><br>"They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the<br>nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven<br>days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm<br>captain."<br><br>"What fun it must be!"<br><br>"Yes," said cunning Peter, "but we are rather lonely. You see we have no<br>female companionship."<br><br>"Are none of the others girls?"<br><br>"Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their<br>prams."<br><br>This flattered Wendy immensely. "I think," she said, "it is perfectly<br>lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us."<br><br>For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one<br>kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she<br>told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,<br>John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him<br>to remain there. "And I know you meant to be kind," she said, relenting,<br>"so you may give me a kiss."<br><br>For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. "I thought<br>you would want it back," he said a little bitterly, and offered to<br>return her the thimble.<br><br>"Oh dear," said the nice Wendy, "I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble."<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"It's like this." She kissed him.<br><br>"Funny!" said Peter gravely. "Now shall I give you a thimble?"<br><br>"If you wish to," said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.<br><br>Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. "What is it,<br>Wendy?"<br><br>"It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair."<br><br>"That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before."<br><br>And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.<br><br>"She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a<br>thimble."<br><br>"But why?"<br><br>"Why, Tink?"<br><br>Again Tink replied, "You silly ass." Peter could not understand why,<br>but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he<br>admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen<br>to stories.<br><br>"You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any<br>stories."<br><br>"How perfectly awful," Wendy said.<br><br>"Do you know," Peter asked "why swallows build in the eaves of houses?<br>It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you<br>such a lovely story."<br><br>"Which story was it?"<br><br>"About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass<br>slipper."<br><br>"Peter," said Wendy excitedly, "that was Cinderella, and he found her,<br>and they lived happily ever after."<br><br>Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been<br>sitting, and hurried to the window.<br><br>"Where are you going?" she cried with misgiving.<br><br>"To tell the other boys."<br><br>"Don't go Peter," she entreated, "I know such lots of stories."<br><br>Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she<br>who first tempted him.<br><br>He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to<br>have alarmed her, but did not.<br><br>"Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!" she cried, and then Peter<br>gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.<br><br>"Let me go!" she ordered him.<br><br>"Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys."<br><br>Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, "Oh dear, I<br>can't. Think of mummy! Besides, I can't fly."<br><br>"I'll teach you."<br><br>"Oh, how lovely to fly."<br><br>"I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back, and then away we go."<br><br>"Oo!" she exclaimed rapturously.<br><br>"Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be<br>flying about with me saying funny things to the stars."<br><br>"Oo!"<br><br>"And, Wendy, there are mermaids."<br><br>"Mermaids! With tails?"<br><br>"Such long tails."<br><br>"Oh," cried Wendy, "to see a mermaid!"<br><br>He had become frightfully cunning. "Wendy," he said, "how we should all<br>respect you."<br><br>She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were<br>trying to remain on the nursery floor.<br><br>But he had no pity for her.<br><br>"Wendy," he said, the sly one, "you could tuck us in at night."<br><br>"Oo!"<br><br>"None of us has ever been tucked in at night."<br><br>"Oo," and her arms went out to him.<br><br>"And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has<br>any pockets."<br><br>How could she resist. "Of course it's awfully fascinating!" she cried.<br>"Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?"<br><br>"If you like," he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael<br>and shook them. "Wake up," she cried, "Peter Pan has come and he is to<br>teach us to fly."<br><br>John rubbed his eyes. "Then I shall get up," he said. Of course he was<br>on the floor already. "Hallo," he said, "I am up!"<br><br>Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six<br>blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed<br>the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up<br>world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop!<br>Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the<br>evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they had heard.<br><br>"Out with the light! Hide! Quick!" cried John, taking command for the<br>only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,<br>holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and<br>you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing<br>angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from<br>behind the window curtains.<br><br>Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in<br>the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her<br>cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting<br>a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in<br>custody of course.<br><br>"There, you suspicious brute," she said, not sorry that Nana was in<br>disgrace. "They are perfectly safe, aren't they? Every one of the little<br>angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing."<br><br>Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they<br>were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to<br>drag herself out of Liza's clutches.<br><br>But Liza was dense. "No more of it, Nana," she said sternly, pulling<br>her out of the room. "I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight<br>for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,<br>won't master whip you, just."<br><br>She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark?<br>Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she<br>wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her<br>charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and<br>Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at<br>the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she had burst<br>into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most<br>expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at<br>once that something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without<br>a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.<br><br>But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing<br>behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.<br><br>We now return to the nursery.<br><br>"It's all right," John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. "I<br>say, Peter, can you really fly?"<br><br>Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking<br>the mantelpiece on the way.<br><br>"How topping!" said John and Michael.<br><br>"How sweet!" cried Wendy.<br><br>"Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!" said Peter, forgetting his manners<br>again.<br><br>It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and<br>then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.<br><br>"I say, how do you do it?" asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a<br>practical boy.<br><br>"You just think lovely wonderful thoughts," Peter explained, "and they<br>lift you up in the air."<br><br>He showed them again.<br><br>"You're so nippy at it," John said, "couldn't you do it very slowly<br>once?"<br><br>Peter did it both slowly and quickly. "I've got it now, Wendy!" cried<br>John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,<br>though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not<br>know A from Z.<br><br>Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless<br>the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned,<br>one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them,<br>with the most superb results.<br><br>"Now just wiggle your shoulders this way," he said, "and let go."<br><br>They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did<br>not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne<br>across the room.<br><br>"I flewed!" he screamed while still in mid-air.<br><br>John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.<br><br>"Oh, lovely!"<br><br>"Oh, ripping!"<br><br>"Look at me!"<br><br>"Look at me!"<br><br>"Look at me!"<br><br>They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a<br>little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is<br>almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,<br>but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.<br><br>Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word.<br><br>"I say," cried John, "why shouldn't we all go out?"<br><br>Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.<br><br>Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion<br>miles. But Wendy hesitated.<br><br>"Mermaids!" said Peter again.<br><br>"Oo!"<br><br>"And there are pirates."<br><br>"Pirates," cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, "let us go at once."<br><br>It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana<br>out of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the<br>nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze<br>with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in<br>shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling<br>round and round, not on the floor but in the air.<br><br>Not three figures, four!<br><br>In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed<br>upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to<br>make her heart go softly.<br><br>Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and<br>we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On<br>the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will<br>all come right in the end.<br><br>They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the<br>little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window<br>open, and that smallest star of all called out:<br><br>"Cave, Peter!"<br><br>Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. "Come," he cried<br>imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and<br>Michael and Wendy.<br><br>Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The<br>birds were flown.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 4.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 4. THE FLIGHT<br><br>"Second to the right, and straight on till morning."<br><br>That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even<br>birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not<br>have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said<br>anything that came into his head.<br><br>At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the<br>delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or<br>any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.<br><br>John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.<br><br>They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought<br>themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.<br><br>Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before<br>this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their<br>second sea and their third night.<br><br>Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold<br>and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they<br>merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding<br>them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable<br>for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and<br>snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for<br>miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy<br>noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this<br>was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that<br>there are other ways.<br><br>Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that<br>was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful<br>thing was that Peter thought this funny.<br><br>"There he goes again!" he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly<br>dropped like a stone.<br><br>"Save him, save him!" cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel<br>sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch<br>Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way<br>he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it<br>was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life.<br>Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment<br>would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility<br>that the next time you fell he would let you go.<br><br>He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back<br>and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light<br>that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.<br><br>"Do be more polite to him," Wendy whispered to John, when they were<br>playing "Follow my Leader."<br><br>"Then tell him to stop showing off," said John.<br><br>When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and<br>touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run<br>your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this<br>with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially<br>as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.<br><br>"You must be nice to him," Wendy impressed on her brothers. "What could<br>we do if he were to leave us!"<br><br>"We could go back," Michael said.<br><br>"How could we ever find our way back without him?"<br><br>"Well, then, we could go on," said John.<br><br>"That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don't<br>know how to stop."<br><br>This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.<br><br>John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to<br>go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come<br>back to their own window.<br><br>"And who is to get food for us, John?"<br><br>"I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, Wendy."<br><br>"After the twentieth try," Wendy reminded him. "And even though we<br>became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things<br>if he is not near to give us a hand."<br><br>Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though<br>they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of<br>them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump<br>into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round<br>Michael's forehead by this time.<br><br>Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up<br>there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would<br>suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no<br>share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had<br>been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he<br>would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be<br>able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really rather<br>irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.<br><br>"And if he forgets them so quickly," Wendy argued, "how can we expect<br>that he will go on remembering us?"<br><br>Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least<br>not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes<br>as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she<br>had to call him by name.<br><br>"I'm Wendy," she said agitatedly.<br><br>He was very sorry. "I say, Wendy," he whispered to her, "always if you<br>see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll<br>remember."<br><br>Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he<br>showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their<br>way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several<br>times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they<br>would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon<br>he would cry in his captain voice, "We get off here." So with occasional<br>tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for<br>after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been<br>going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the<br>guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It<br>is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.<br><br>"There it is," said Peter calmly.<br><br>"Where, where?"<br><br>"Where all the arrows are pointing."<br><br>Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all<br>directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their<br>way before leaving them for the night.<br><br>Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their<br>first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at<br>once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something<br>long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they<br>were returning home for the holidays.<br><br>"John, there's the lagoon."<br><br>"Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand."<br><br>"I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!"<br><br>"Look, Michael, there's your cave!"<br><br>"John, what's that in the brushwood?"<br><br>"It's a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that's your little<br>whelp!"<br><br>"There's my boat, John, with her sides stove in!"<br><br>"No, it isn't. Why, we burned your boat."<br><br>"That's her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin<br>camp!"<br><br>"Where? Show me, and I'll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they<br>are on the war-path."<br><br>"There, just across the Mysterious River."<br><br>"I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough."<br><br>Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he<br>wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told<br>you that anon fear fell upon them?<br><br>It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.<br><br>In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little<br>dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it<br>and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of<br>prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that<br>you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on. You<br>even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and<br>that the Neverland was all make-believe.<br><br>Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it<br>was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker<br>every moment, and where was Nana?<br><br>They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His<br>careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle<br>went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over<br>the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their<br>feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had<br>become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way<br>through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had<br>beaten on it with his fists.<br><br>"They don't want us to land," he explained.<br><br>"Who are they?" Wendy whispered, shuddering.<br><br>But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his<br>shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.<br><br>Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his<br>hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that<br>they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he<br>went on again.<br><br>His courage was almost appalling. "Would you like an adventure now," he<br>said casually to John, "or would you like to have your tea first?"<br><br>Wendy said "tea first" quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in<br>gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.<br><br>"What kind of adventure?" he asked cautiously.<br><br>"There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us," Peter told him.<br>"If you like, we'll go down and kill him."<br><br>"I don't see him," John said after a long pause.<br><br>"I do."<br><br>"Suppose," John said, a little huskily, "he were to wake up."<br><br>Peter spoke indignantly. "You don't think I would kill him while he was<br>sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That's the way I<br>always do."<br><br>"I say! Do you kill many?"<br><br>"Tons."<br><br>John said "How ripping," but decided to have tea first. He asked if<br>there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had<br>never known so many.<br><br>"Who is captain now?"<br><br>"Hook," answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that<br>hated word.<br><br>"Jas. Hook?"<br><br>"Ay."<br><br>Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps<br>only, for they knew Hook's reputation.<br><br>"He was Blackbeard's bo'sun," John whispered huskily. "He is the worst<br>of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid."<br><br>"That's him," said Peter.<br><br>"What is he like? Is he big?"<br><br>"He is not so big as he was."<br><br>"How do you mean?"<br><br>"I cut off a bit of him."<br><br>"You!"<br><br>"Yes, me," said Peter sharply.<br><br>"I wasn't meaning to be disrespectful."<br><br>"Oh, all right."<br><br>"But, I say, what bit?"<br><br>"His right hand."<br><br>"Then he can't fight now?"<br><br>"Oh, can't he just!"<br><br>"Left-hander?"<br><br>"He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it."<br><br>"Claws!"<br><br>"I say, John," said Peter.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Say, 'Ay, ay, sir.'"<br><br>"Ay, ay, sir."<br><br>"There is one thing," Peter continued, "that every boy who serves under<br>me has to promise, and so must you."<br><br>John paled.<br><br>"It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me."<br><br>"I promise," John said loyally.<br><br>For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying<br>with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.<br>Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go<br>round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo. Wendy<br>quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.<br><br>"She tells me," he said, "that the pirates sighted us before the<br>darkness came, and got Long Tom out."<br><br>"The big gun?"<br><br>"Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are<br>near it they are sure to let fly."<br><br>"Wendy!"<br><br>"John!"<br><br>"Michael!"<br><br>"Tell her to go away at once, Peter," the three cried simultaneously,<br>but he refused.<br><br>"She thinks we have lost the way," he replied stiffly, "and she is<br>rather frightened. You don't think I would send her away all by herself<br>when she is frightened!"<br><br>For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a<br>loving little pinch.<br><br>"Then tell her," Wendy begged, "to put out her light."<br><br>"She can't put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can't do. It<br>just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars."<br><br>"Then tell her to sleep at once," John almost ordered.<br><br>"She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other thing<br>fairies can't do."<br><br>"Seems to me," growled John, "these are the only two things worth<br>doing."<br><br>Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.<br><br>"If only one of us had a pocket," Peter said, "we could carry her in<br>it." However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a<br>pocket between the four of them.<br><br>He had a happy idea. John's hat!<br><br>Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried<br>it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took<br>the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and<br>this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be<br>under an obligation to Wendy.<br><br>In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in<br>silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by<br>a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at<br>the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches<br>of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening<br>their knives.<br><br>Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. "If<br>only something would make a sound!" he cried.<br><br>As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous<br>crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.<br><br>The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to<br>cry savagely, "Where are they, where are they, where are they?"<br><br>Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an<br>island of make-believe and the same island come true.<br><br>When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael<br>found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air<br>mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.<br><br>"Are you shot?" John whispered tremulously.<br><br>"I haven't tried [myself out] yet," Michael whispered back.<br><br>We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried<br>by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards<br>with no companion but Tinker Bell.<br><br>It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the<br>hat.<br><br>I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had<br>planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began<br>to lure Wendy to her destruction.<br><br>Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the<br>other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or<br>the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one<br>feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it<br>must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy.<br>What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand,<br>and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she<br>flew back and forward, plainly meaning "Follow me, and all will be<br>well."<br><br>What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael,<br>and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink<br>hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered,<br>and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her doom.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 5.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 5. THE ISLAND COME TRUE<br><br>Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke<br>into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is<br>better and was always used by Peter.<br><br>In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take<br>an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the<br>redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and<br>lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the<br>coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you<br>put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething<br>with life.<br><br>On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows.<br>The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking<br>for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and<br>the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were going round and<br>round the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the<br>same rate.<br><br>All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night<br>were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course,<br>in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem<br>to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but<br>at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let us<br>pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by<br>in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.<br><br>They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear<br>the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round<br>and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very<br>sure-footed.<br><br>The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most<br>unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures<br>than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when<br>he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the<br>opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and<br>then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This<br>ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead<br>of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the<br>humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for<br>you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if<br>accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who<br>is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing her<br>mischief], and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys.<br>'Ware Tinker Bell.<br><br>Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he<br>passes by, biting his knuckles.<br><br>Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts<br>whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.<br>Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the<br>days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has<br>given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, [a<br>person who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has he had to<br>deliver up his person when Peter said sternly, "Stand forth the one who<br>did this thing," that now at the command he stands forth automatically<br>whether he has done it or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be<br>described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one.<br>Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his band were not allowed<br>to know anything he did not know, so these two were always vague about<br>themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close<br>together in an apologetic sort of way.<br><br>The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,<br>for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We<br>hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:<br><br>     "Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,<br>     A-pirating we go,<br>     And if we're parted by a shot<br>     We're sure to meet below!"<br><br>A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.<br>Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the<br>ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as<br>ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters<br>of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic<br>black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with<br>which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the<br>Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill<br>Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop<br>the bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces]; and Cookson, said to<br>be Black Murphy's brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman<br>Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways<br>of killing; and Skylights (Morgan's Skylights); and the Irish bo'sun<br>Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence,<br>and was the only Non-conformist in Hook's crew; and Noodler, whose<br>hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many<br>another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main.<br><br>In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting,<br>reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is<br>said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in<br>a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right<br>hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them<br>to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed<br>them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous [dead<br>looking] and blackavized [dark faced], and his hair was dressed in long<br>curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a<br>singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes<br>were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,<br>save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots<br>appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the<br>grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with<br>an air, and I have been told that he was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of<br>repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite,<br>which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his<br>diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his<br>demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of<br>indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was<br>the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.<br>In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles<br>II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he<br>bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth<br>he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two<br>cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron<br>claw.<br><br>Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook's method. Skylights will do. As<br>they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace<br>collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech,<br>then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even<br>taken the cigars from his mouth.<br><br>Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will<br>win?<br><br>On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path,<br>which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one<br>of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their<br>naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of<br>boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not<br>to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In<br>the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many<br>scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress.<br>Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily,<br>proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful<br>of dusky Dianas [Diana = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the<br>Piccaninnies, coquettish [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns;<br>there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but<br>she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they pass over<br>fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only sound to be<br>heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are all a<br>little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work<br>this off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.<br><br>The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their<br>place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,<br>tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee<br>from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the<br>man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues are<br>hanging out, they are hungry to-night.<br><br>When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic<br>crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.<br><br>The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession<br>must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its<br>pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.<br><br>All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the<br>danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island<br>was.<br><br>The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung<br>themselves down on the sward [turf], close to their underground home.<br><br>"I do wish Peter would come back," every one of them said nervously,<br>though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than<br>their captain.<br><br>"I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates," Slightly said, in<br>the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some<br>distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, "but I wish he<br>would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about<br>Cinderella."<br><br>They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother<br>must have been very like her.<br><br>It was only in Peter's absence that they could speak of mothers, the<br>subject being forbidden by him as silly.<br><br>"All I remember about my mother," Nibs told them, "is that she often<br>said to my father, 'Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!' I<br>don't know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my<br>mother one."<br><br>While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild<br>things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it<br>was the grim song:<br><br>     "Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,<br>     The flag o' skull and bones,<br>     A merry hour, a hempen rope,<br>     And hey for Davy Jones."<br><br>At once the lost boys--but where are they? They are no longer there.<br>Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.<br><br>I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has<br>darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in their home<br>under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see<br>a good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no<br>entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away,<br>would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may<br>note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its<br>hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the<br>home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these<br>many moons. Will he find it tonight?<br><br>As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs<br>disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But<br>an iron claw gripped his shoulder.<br><br>"Captain, let go!" he cried, writhing.<br><br>Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.<br>"Put back that pistol first," it said threateningly.<br><br>"It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead."<br><br>"Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins upon us. Do<br>you want to lose your scalp?"<br><br>"Shall I after him, Captain," asked pathetic Smee, "and tickle him<br>with Johnny Corkscrew?" Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his<br>cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One<br>could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,<br>it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.<br><br>"Johnny's a silent fellow," he reminded Hook.<br><br>"Not now, Smee," Hook said darkly. "He is only one, and I want to<br>mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them."<br><br>The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain<br>and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it<br>was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there<br>came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo'sun the story of<br>his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee,<br>who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.<br><br>Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.<br><br>"Most of all," Hook was saying passionately, "I want their captain,<br>Peter Pan. 'Twas he cut off my arm." He brandished the hook<br>threateningly. "I've waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I'll<br>tear him!"<br><br>"And yet," said Smee, "I have often heard you say that hook was worth a<br>score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses."<br><br>"Ay," the captain answered, "if I was a mother I would pray to have my<br>children born with this instead of that," and he cast a look of pride<br>upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he<br>frowned.<br><br>"Peter flung my arm," he said, wincing, "to a crocodile that happened to<br>be passing by."<br><br>"I have often," said Smee, "noticed your strange dread of crocodiles."<br><br>"Not of crocodiles," Hook corrected him, "but of that one crocodile." He<br>lowered his voice. "It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed<br>me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips<br>for the rest of me."<br><br>"In a way," said Smee, "it's sort of a compliment."<br><br>"I want no such compliments," Hook barked petulantly. "I want Peter Pan,<br>who first gave the brute its taste for me."<br><br>He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his<br>voice. "Smee," he said huskily, "that crocodile would have had me before<br>this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick<br>inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt." He<br>laughed, but in a hollow way.<br><br>"Some day," said Smee, "the clock will run down, and then he'll get<br>you."<br><br>Hook wetted his dry lips. "Ay," he said, "that's the fear that haunts<br>me."<br><br>Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. "Smee," he said, "this<br>seat is hot." He jumped up. "Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning."<br><br>They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown<br>on the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in<br>their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once<br>to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. "A chimney!" they both<br>exclaimed.<br><br>They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It<br>was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were<br>in the neighbourhood.<br><br>Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for<br>so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily<br>chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom.<br>They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.<br><br>"Did you hear them say Peter Pan's from home?" Smee whispered, fidgeting<br>with Johnny Corkscrew.<br><br>Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a<br>curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.<br>"Unrip your plan, captain," he cried eagerly.<br><br>"To return to the ship," Hook replied slowly through his teeth, "and<br>cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.<br>There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly<br>moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece.<br>That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore<br>of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there,<br>playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble<br>it up, because, having no mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to<br>eat rich damp cake." He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now,<br>but honest laughter. "Aha, they will die."<br><br>Smee had listened with growing admiration.<br><br>"It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!" he cried, and in<br>their exultation they danced and sang:<br><br>     "Avast, belay, when I appear,<br>     By fear they're overtook;<br>     Nought's left upon your bones when you<br>     Have shaken claws with Hook."<br><br>They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound<br>broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a<br>leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it<br>was more distinct.<br><br>Tick tick tick tick!<br><br>Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.<br><br>"The crocodile!" he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo'sun.<br><br>It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on<br>the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.<br><br>Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night<br>were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their<br>midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were<br>hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.<br><br>"Save me, save me!" cried Nibs, falling on the ground.<br><br>"But what can we do, what can we do?"<br><br>It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their<br>thoughts turned to him.<br><br>"What would Peter do?" they cried simultaneously.<br><br>Almost in the same breath they cried, "Peter would look at them through<br>his legs."<br><br>And then, "Let us do what Peter would do."<br><br>It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy<br>they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long<br>one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the<br>terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.<br><br>Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring<br>eyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.<br><br>"I have seen a wonderfuller thing," he cried, as they gathered round him<br>eagerly. "A great white bird. It is flying this way."<br><br>"What kind of a bird, do you think?"<br><br>"I don't know," Nibs said, awestruck, "but it looks so weary, and as it<br>flies it moans, 'Poor Wendy,'"<br><br>"Poor Wendy?"<br><br>"I remember," said Slightly instantly, "there are birds called Wendies."<br><br>"See, it comes!" cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.<br><br>Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.<br>But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous<br>fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting<br>at her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she<br>touched.<br><br>"Hullo, Tink," cried the wondering boys.<br><br>Tink's reply rang out: "Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy."<br><br>It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. "Let us do<br>what Peter wishes!" cried the simple boys. "Quick, bows and arrows!"<br><br>All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with<br>him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.<br><br>"Quick, Tootles, quick," she screamed. "Peter will be so pleased."<br><br>Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. "Out of the way, Tink,"<br>he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an<br>arrow in her breast.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 6.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 6. THE LITTLE HOUSE<br><br>Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy's body when the<br>other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.<br><br>"You are too late," he cried proudly, "I have shot the Wendy. Peter will<br>be so pleased with me."<br><br>Overhead Tinker Bell shouted "Silly ass!" and darted into hiding. The<br>others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they<br>looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy's heart had been<br>beating they would all have heard it.<br><br>Slightly was the first to speak. "This is no bird," he said in a scared<br>voice. "I think this must be a lady."<br><br>"A lady?" said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.<br><br>"And we have killed her," Nibs said hoarsely.<br><br>They all whipped off their caps.<br><br>"Now I see," Curly said: "Peter was bringing her to us." He threw<br>himself sorrowfully on the ground.<br><br>"A lady to take care of us at last," said one of the twins, "and you<br>have killed her!"<br><br>They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a<br>step nearer them they turned from him.<br><br>Tootles' face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that<br>had never been there before.<br><br>"I did it," he said, reflecting. "When ladies used to come to me in<br>dreams, I said, 'Pretty mother, pretty mother.' But when at last she<br>really came, I shot her."<br><br>He moved slowly away.<br><br>"Don't go," they called in pity.<br><br>"I must," he answered, shaking; "I am so afraid of Peter."<br><br>It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the<br>heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.<br><br>"Peter!" they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his<br>return.<br><br>"Hide her," they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But<br>Tootles stood aloof.<br><br>Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.<br>"Greetings, boys," he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then<br>again was silence.<br><br>He frowned.<br><br>"I am back," he said hotly, "why do you not cheer?"<br><br>They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked<br>it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.<br><br>"Great news, boys," he cried, "I have brought at last a mother for you<br>all."<br><br>Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his<br>knees.<br><br>"Have you not seen her?" asked Peter, becoming troubled. "She flew this<br>way."<br><br>"Ah me!" once voice said, and another said, "Oh, mournful day."<br><br>Tootles rose. "Peter," he said quietly, "I will show her to you," and<br>when the others would still have hidden her he said, "Back, twins, let<br>Peter see."<br><br>So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a<br>little time he did not know what to do next.<br><br>"She is dead," he said uncomfortably. "Perhaps she is frightened at<br>being dead."<br><br>He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of<br>sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would<br>all have been glad to follow if he had done this.<br><br>But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.<br><br>"Whose arrow?" he demanded sternly.<br><br>"Mine, Peter," said Tootles on his knees.<br><br>"Oh, dastard hand," Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a<br>dagger.<br><br>Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. "Strike, Peter," he said<br>firmly, "strike true."<br><br>Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. "I cannot<br>strike," he said with awe, "there is something stays my hand."<br><br>All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.<br><br>"It is she," he cried, "the Wendy lady, see, her arm!"<br><br>Wonderful to relate [tell], Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over<br>her and listened reverently. "I think she said, 'Poor Tootles,'" he<br>whispered.<br><br>"She lives," Peter said briefly.<br><br>Slightly cried instantly, "The Wendy lady lives."<br><br>Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had<br>put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.<br><br>"See," he said, "the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave<br>her. It has saved her life."<br><br>"I remember kisses," Slightly interposed quickly, "let me see it. Ay,<br>that's a kiss."<br><br>Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so<br>that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet,<br>being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.<br><br>"Listen to Tink," said Curly, "she is crying because the Wendy lives."<br><br>Then they had to tell Peter of Tink's crime, and almost never had they<br>seen him look so stern.<br><br>"Listen, Tinker Bell," he cried, "I am your friend no more. Begone from<br>me for ever."<br><br>She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not<br>until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,<br>"Well, not for ever, but for a whole week."<br><br>Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh<br>dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,<br>and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed [slapped] them.<br><br>But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?<br><br>"Let us carry her down into the house," Curly suggested.<br><br>"Ay," said Slightly, "that is what one does with ladies."<br><br>"No, no," Peter said, "you must not touch her. It would not be<br>sufficiently respectful."<br><br>"That," said Slightly, "is what I was thinking."<br><br>"But if she lies there," Tootles said, "she will die."<br><br>"Ay, she will die," Slightly admitted, "but there is no way out."<br><br>"Yes, there is," cried Peter. "Let us build a little house round her."<br><br>They were all delighted. "Quick," he ordered them, "bring me each of you<br>the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp."<br><br>In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.<br>They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and<br>while they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they<br>dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,<br>moved another step and slept again.<br><br>"John, John," Michael would cry, "wake up! Where is Nana, John, and<br>mother?"<br><br>And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, "It is true, we did fly."<br><br>You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.<br><br>"Hullo, Peter," they said.<br><br>"Hullo," replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them.<br>He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see<br>how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for<br>chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.<br><br>"Is Wendy asleep?" they asked.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"John," Michael proposed, "let us wake her and get her to make supper<br>for us," but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying<br>branches for the building of the house. "Look at them!" he cried.<br><br>"Curly," said Peter in his most captainy voice, "see that these boys<br>help in the building of the house."<br><br>"Ay, ay, sir."<br><br>"Build a house?" exclaimed John.<br><br>"For the Wendy," said Curly.<br><br>"For Wendy?" John said, aghast. "Why, she is only a girl!"<br><br>"That," explained Curly, "is why we are her servants."<br><br>"You? Wendy's servants!"<br><br>"Yes," said Peter, "and you also. Away with them."<br><br>The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.<br>"Chairs and a fender [fireplace] first," Peter ordered. "Then we shall<br>build a house round them."<br><br>"Ay," said Slightly, "that is how a house is built; it all comes back to<br>me."<br><br>Peter thought of everything. "Slightly," he cried, "fetch a doctor."<br><br>"Ay, ay," said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.<br>But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing<br>John's hat and looking solemn.<br><br>"Please, sir," said Peter, going to him, "are you a doctor?"<br><br>The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that<br>they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were<br>exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had<br>to make-believe that they had had their dinners.<br><br>If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.<br><br>"Yes, my little man," Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped<br>knuckles.<br><br>"Please, sir," Peter explained, "a lady lies very ill."<br><br>She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.<br><br>"Tut, tut, tut," he said, "where does she lie?"<br><br>"In yonder glade."<br><br>"I will put a glass thing in her mouth," said Slightly, and he<br>made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when<br>the glass thing was withdrawn.<br><br>"How is she?" inquired Peter.<br><br>"Tut, tut, tut," said Slightly, "this has cured her."<br><br>"I am glad!" Peter cried.<br><br>"I will call again in the evening," Slightly said; "give her beef tea<br>out of a cup with a spout to it;" but after he had returned the hat<br>to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a<br>difficulty.<br><br>In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost<br>everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy's feet.<br><br>"If only we knew," said one, "the kind of house she likes best."<br><br>"Peter," shouted another, "she is moving in her sleep."<br><br>"Her mouth opens," cried a third, looking respectfully into it. "Oh,<br>lovely!"<br><br>"Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep," said Peter. "Wendy, sing<br>the kind of house you would like to have."<br><br>Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:<br><br>     "I wish I had a pretty house,<br>     The littlest ever seen,<br>     With funny little red walls<br>     And roof of mossy green."<br><br>They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the<br>branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground<br>was carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke<br>into song themselves:<br><br>     "We've built the little walls and roof<br>     And made a lovely door,<br>     So tell us, mother Wendy,<br>     What are you wanting more?"<br><br>To this she answered greedily:<br><br>     "Oh, really next I think I'll have<br>     Gay windows all about,<br>     With roses peeping in, you know,<br>     And babies peeping out."<br><br>With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves<br>were the blinds. But roses--?<br><br>"Roses," cried Peter sternly.<br><br>Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.<br><br>Babies?<br><br>To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:<br><br>     "We've made the roses peeping out,<br>     The babes are at the door,<br>     We cannot make ourselves, you know,<br>     'cos we've been made before."<br><br>Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his<br>own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy<br>within, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode<br>up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes.<br>Just when it seemed absolutely finished:<br><br>"There's no knocker on the door," he said.<br><br>They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it<br>made an excellent knocker.<br><br>Absolutely finished now, they thought.<br><br>Not of bit of it. "There's no chimney," Peter said; "we must have a<br>chimney."<br><br>"It certainly does need a chimney," said John importantly. This gave<br>Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John's head, knocked out the<br>bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so<br>pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you,<br>smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.<br><br>Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to<br>knock.<br><br>"All look your best," Peter warned them; "first impressions are awfully<br>important."<br><br>He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all<br>too busy looking their best.<br><br>He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not<br>a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a<br>branch and openly sneering.<br><br>What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a<br>lady, what would she be like?<br><br>The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off<br>their hats.<br><br>She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she<br>would look.<br><br>"Where am I?" she said.<br><br>Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. "Wendy lady," he<br>said rapidly, "for you we built this house."<br><br>"Oh, say you're pleased," cried Nibs.<br><br>"Lovely, darling house," Wendy said, and they were the very words they<br>had hoped she would say.<br><br>"And we are your children," cried the twins.<br><br>Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, "O Wendy<br>lady, be our mother."<br><br>"Ought I?" Wendy said, all shining. "Of course it's frightfully<br>fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real<br>experience."<br><br>"That doesn't matter," said Peter, as if he were the only person present<br>who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew least.<br>"What we need is just a nice motherly person."<br><br>"Oh dear!" Wendy said, "you see, I feel that is exactly what I am."<br><br>"It is, it is," they all cried; "we saw it at once."<br><br>"Very well," she said, "I will do my best. Come inside at once, you<br>naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to<br>bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella."<br><br>In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can<br>squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many<br>joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the<br>great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night<br>in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for<br>the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the<br>prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with<br>a bright light showing through its blinds, and the chimney smoking<br>beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time he fell asleep,<br>and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from<br>an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they<br>would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed on.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 7.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 7. THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND<br><br>One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John<br>and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the<br>boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for<br>unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no<br>two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in<br>[let out] your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the<br>right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so<br>wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able<br>to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more<br>graceful.<br><br>But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as<br>carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the<br>clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.<br>Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments<br>or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available<br>tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you<br>fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this,<br>as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect<br>condition.<br><br>Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to<br>be altered a little.<br><br>After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets<br>in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the<br>ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses<br>should do, with a floor in which you could dig [for worms] if you wanted<br>to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming<br>colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in<br>the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,<br>level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and<br>then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;<br>as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus<br>there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was<br>in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across<br>this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended<br>her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at<br>6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it,<br>except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule<br>against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at<br>once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have [desired]<br>a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the<br>short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.<br><br>It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made<br>of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one<br>recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private<br>apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of<br>the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious<br>[particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman,<br>however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room]<br>and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was<br>a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads<br>according to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a<br>Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to<br>fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest<br>of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the<br>best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier<br>from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the<br>residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house,<br>as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful,<br>looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently<br>turned up.<br><br>I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those<br>rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole<br>weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never<br>above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and<br>even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to<br>keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly<br>knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all<br>depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of<br>a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel<br>stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than<br>anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe<br>was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting<br>rounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead,<br>and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree<br>he let you stodge.<br><br>Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all<br>gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for<br>herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting<br>double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on<br>their knees.<br><br>When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a<br>hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, "Oh dear, I am sure<br>I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!"<br><br>Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.<br><br>You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she<br>had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each<br>other's arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.<br><br>As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had<br>left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite<br>impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is<br>calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them<br>than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry<br>about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they<br>would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave<br>her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John<br>remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while<br>Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.<br>These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she<br>tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination<br>papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.<br>The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on<br>joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,<br>writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another<br>slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary questions--"What<br>was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was<br>Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible."<br>"(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last<br>Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared. Only one of<br>these to be attempted." Or "(1) Describe Mother's laugh; (2) Describe<br>Father's laugh; (3) Describe Mother's Party Dress; (4) Describe the<br>Kennel and its Inmate."<br><br>They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not<br>answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful<br>what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who<br>replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more<br>hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,<br>and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.<br><br>Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except<br>Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could<br>neither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that<br>sort of thing.<br><br>By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What<br>was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been<br>forgetting, too.<br><br>Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but<br>about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that<br>fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it,<br>which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.<br>It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of<br>thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools<br>flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and<br>coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter<br>doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking<br>solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to<br>do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For<br>several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and<br>John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would<br>have treated them severely.<br><br>He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely<br>certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten<br>it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went<br>out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great<br>deal about it, and yet you could not find the body. Sometimes he came<br>home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed<br>it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never<br>quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she<br>knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still<br>more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and<br>said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as<br>large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can<br>do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The<br>difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the<br>redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and<br>especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which<br>was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides. At the<br>Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way<br>and sometimes that, he called out, "I'm redskin to-day; what are you,<br>Tootles?" And Tootles answered, "Redskin; what are you, Nibs?" and<br>Nibs said, "Redskin; what are you Twin?" and so on; and they were all<br>redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real<br>redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that<br>once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.<br><br>The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided<br>yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one<br>would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground,<br>when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out<br>like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the<br>Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally.<br><br>Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might<br>eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after<br>another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so<br>that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and<br>was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.<br><br>Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly<br>of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how<br>the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and<br>Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty<br>story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell<br>it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would<br>of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter<br>adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the<br>help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a<br>great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and<br>Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might<br>choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him<br>on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he<br>waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly<br>from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.<br><br>Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss<br>for it.<br><br>I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that<br>the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won. Of course I could do it<br>again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick<br>to the lagoon.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 8.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 8. THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON<br><br>If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a<br>shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then<br>if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the<br>colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.<br>But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest<br>you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there<br>could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids<br>singing.<br><br>The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or<br>floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water,<br>and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on<br>friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting<br>regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil<br>word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon<br>she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where<br>they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite<br>irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within<br>a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her<br>with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.<br><br>They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who<br>chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails<br>when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.<br><br>The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,<br>when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for<br>mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy<br>had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course<br>Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules<br>about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,<br>however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in<br>extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many<br>colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily<br>from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the<br>rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and<br>the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of<br>these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a<br>pretty sight.<br><br>But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by<br>themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we<br>have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not<br>above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting<br>the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted<br>it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.<br><br>It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a<br>rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on<br>their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was<br>make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened<br>in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.<br><br>It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock. The rock was<br>not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how<br>not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with<br>their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was<br>not looking. She was very busy, stitching.<br><br>While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over<br>it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning<br>it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she<br>looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing<br>place seemed formidable and unfriendly.<br><br>It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as<br>night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent<br>that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?<br><br>There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners'<br>Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave<br>them there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is<br>submerged.<br><br>Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely<br>because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was<br>no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was<br>a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must<br>stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though<br>fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not<br>waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her<br>heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them to<br>let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?<br><br>It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could<br>sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at<br>once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.<br><br>He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.<br><br>"Pirates!" he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was<br>playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile<br>was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand<br>ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.<br><br>"Dive!"<br><br>There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.<br>Marooners' Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were<br>itself marooned.<br><br>The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in<br>her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger<br>Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her<br>fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her<br>race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written<br>in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the<br>happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter<br>of a chief, she must die as a chief's daughter, it is enough.<br><br>They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.<br>No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook's boast that the wind of<br>his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to<br>guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.<br><br>In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the<br>rock till they crashed into it.<br><br>"Luff, you lubber," cried an Irish voice that was Smee's; "here's the<br>rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and<br>leave her here to drown."<br><br>It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the<br>rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.<br><br>Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and<br>down, Peter's and Wendy's. Wendy was crying, for it was the first<br>tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had<br>forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was<br>two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way<br>would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one<br>to choose the easy way.<br><br>There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice<br>of Hook.<br><br>"Ahoy there, you lubbers!" he called. It was a marvellous imitation.<br><br>"The captain!" said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.<br><br>"He must be swimming out to us," Starkey said, when they had looked for<br>him in vain.<br><br>"We are putting the redskin on the rock," Smee called out.<br><br>"Set her free," came the astonishing answer.<br><br>"Free!"<br><br>"Yes, cut her bonds and let her go."<br><br>"But, captain--"<br><br>"At once, d'ye hear," cried Peter, "or I'll plunge my hook in you."<br><br>"This is queer!" Smee gasped.<br><br>"Better do what the captain orders," said Starkey nervously.<br><br>"Ay, ay." Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily's cords. At once like an eel<br>she slid between Starkey's legs into the water.<br><br>Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter's cleverness; but she knew<br>that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray<br>himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was<br>stayed even in the act, for "Boat ahoy!" rang over the lagoon in Hook's<br>voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.<br><br>Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of<br>surprise instead.<br><br>"Boat ahoy!" again came the voice.<br><br>Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.<br><br>He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him<br>he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook<br>grip the boat's side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping<br>from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but<br>Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with<br>conceit. "Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!" he whispered to her,<br>and though she thought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his<br>reputation that no one heard him except herself.<br><br>He signed to her to listen.<br><br>The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain<br>to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound<br>melancholy.<br><br>"Captain, is all well?" they asked timidly, but he answered with a<br>hollow moan.<br><br>"He sighs," said Smee.<br><br>"He sighs again," said Starkey.<br><br>"And yet a third time he sighs," said Smee.<br><br>Then at last he spoke passionately.<br><br>"The game's up," he cried, "those boys have found a mother."<br><br>Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.<br><br>"O evil day!" cried Starkey.<br><br>"What's a mother?" asked the ignorant Smee.<br><br>Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. "He doesn't know!" and always<br>after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be<br>her one.<br><br>Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,<br>"What was that?"<br><br>"I heard nothing," said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,<br>and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I<br>have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting<br>on it.<br><br>"See," said Hook in answer to Smee's question, "that is a mother. What<br>a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother<br>desert her eggs? No."<br><br>There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent<br>days when--but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.<br><br>Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but<br>the more suspicious Starkey said, "If she is a mother, perhaps she is<br>hanging about here to help Peter."<br><br>Hook winced. "Ay," he said, "that is the fear that haunts me."<br><br>He was roused from this dejection by Smee's eager voice.<br><br>"Captain," said Smee, "could we not kidnap these boys' mother and make<br>her our mother?"<br><br>"It is a princely scheme," cried Hook, and at once it took practical<br>shape in his great brain. "We will seize the children and carry them to<br>the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our<br>mother."<br><br>Again Wendy forgot herself.<br><br>"Never!" she cried, and bobbed.<br><br>"What was that?"<br><br>But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the<br>wind. "Do you agree, my bullies?" asked Hook.<br><br>"There is my hand on it," they both said.<br><br>"And there is my hook. Swear."<br><br>They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook<br>remembered Tiger Lily.<br><br>"Where is the redskin?" he demanded abruptly.<br><br>He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the<br>moments.<br><br>"That is all right, captain," Smee answered complacently; "we let her<br>go."<br><br>"Let her go!" cried Hook.<br><br>"'Twas your own orders," the bo'sun faltered.<br><br>"You called over the water to us to let her go," said Starkey.<br><br>"Brimstone and gall," thundered Hook, "what cozening [cheating] is<br>going on here!" His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they<br>believed their words, and he was startled. "Lads," he said, shaking a<br>little, "I gave no such order."<br><br>"It is passing queer," Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.<br>Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.<br><br>"Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night," he cried, "dost hear<br>me?"<br><br>Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He<br>immediately answered in Hook's voice:<br><br>"Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you."<br><br>In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee<br>and Starkey clung to each other in terror.<br><br>"Who are you, stranger? Speak!" Hook demanded.<br><br>"I am James Hook," replied the voice, "captain of the JOLLY ROGER."<br><br>"You are not; you are not," Hook cried hoarsely.<br><br>"Brimstone and gall," the voice retorted, "say that again, and I'll cast<br>anchor in you."<br><br>Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. "If you are Hook," he said almost<br>humbly, "come tell me, who am I?"<br><br>"A codfish," replied the voice, "only a codfish."<br><br>"A codfish!" Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then,<br>that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.<br><br>"Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!" they muttered. "It<br>is lowering to our pride."<br><br>They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had<br>become, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was<br>not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego<br>slipping from him. "Don't desert me, bully," he whispered hoarsely to<br>it.<br><br>In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the<br>great pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried<br>the guessing game.<br><br>"Hook," he called, "have you another voice?"<br><br>Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own<br>voice, "I have."<br><br>"And another name?"<br><br>"Ay, ay."<br><br>"Vegetable?" asked Hook.<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Mineral?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Animal?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Man?"<br><br>"No!" This answer rang out scornfully.<br><br>"Boy?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Ordinary boy?"<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"Wonderful boy?"<br><br>To Wendy's pain the answer that rang out this time was "Yes."<br><br>"Are you in England?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Are you here?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Hook was completely puzzled. "You ask him some questions," he said to<br>the others, wiping his damp brow.<br><br>Smee reflected. "I can't think of a thing," he said regretfully.<br><br>"Can't guess, can't guess!" crowed Peter. "Do you give it up?"<br><br>Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the<br>miscreants [villains] saw their chance.<br><br>"Yes, yes," they answered eagerly.<br><br>"Well, then," he cried, "I am Peter Pan."<br><br>Pan!<br><br>In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his<br>faithful henchmen.<br><br>"Now we have him," Hook shouted. "Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind<br>the boat. Take him dead or alive!"<br><br>He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.<br><br>"Are you ready, boys?"<br><br>"Ay, ay," from various parts of the lagoon.<br><br>"Then lam into the pirates."<br><br>The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who<br>gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce<br>struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. He<br>wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.<br><br>Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash<br>of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at<br>their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but<br>he was himself pinked [nicked] in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock<br>Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.<br><br>Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.<br><br>The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing<br>from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round<br>him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.<br><br>But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter<br>that circle.<br><br>Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock<br>to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite<br>side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than<br>climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip<br>met the other's arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces<br>were almost touching; so they met.<br><br>Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to<br>[began combat] they had a sinking [feeling in the stomach]. Had it been<br>so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After all, he was the<br>only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no sinking, he had<br>one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy.<br>Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook's belt and was about to<br>drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock that his foe.<br>It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help<br>him up.<br><br>It was then that Hook bit him.<br><br>Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made<br>him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is<br>affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he<br>has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After<br>you have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never<br>afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first<br>unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot<br>it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest.<br><br>So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just<br>stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.<br><br>A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking<br>wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white<br>fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary<br>occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were<br>uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the<br>lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went<br>home in it, shouting "Peter, Wendy" as they went, but no answer came<br>save mocking laughter from the mermaids. "They must be swimming back or<br>flying," the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they<br>had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be<br>late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault!<br><br>When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and<br>then a feeble cry.<br><br>"Help, help!"<br><br>Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted<br>and lay on the boy's arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the<br>rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that<br>the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he<br>could do no more.<br><br>As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began<br>pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,<br>woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to<br>tell her the truth.<br><br>"We are on the rock, Wendy," he said, "but it is growing smaller. Soon<br>the water will be over it."<br><br>She did not understand even now.<br><br>"We must go," she said, almost brightly.<br><br>"Yes," he answered faintly.<br><br>"Shall we swim or fly, Peter?"<br><br>He had to tell her.<br><br>"Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without<br>my help?"<br><br>She had to admit that she was too tired.<br><br>He moaned.<br><br>"What is it?" she asked, anxious about him at once.<br><br>"I can't help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim."<br><br>"Do you mean we shall both be drowned?"<br><br>"Look how the water is rising."<br><br>They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought<br>they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against<br>Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, "Can I<br>be of any use?"<br><br>It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It<br>had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.<br><br>"Michael's kite," Peter said without interest, but next moment he had<br>seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.<br><br>"It lifted Michael off the ground," he cried; "why should it not carry<br>you?"<br><br>"Both of us!"<br><br>"It can't lift two; Michael and Curly tried."<br><br>"Let us draw lots," Wendy said bravely.<br><br>"And you a lady; never." Already he had tied the tail round her. She<br>clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a "Good-bye,<br>Wendy," he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne<br>out of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.<br><br>The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of<br>light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a<br>sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the<br>mermaids calling to the moon.<br><br>Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A<br>tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on<br>the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and<br>Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock<br>again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was<br>saying, "To die will be an awfully big adventure."<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 9.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 9. THE NEVER BIRD<br><br>The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids<br>retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far<br>away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where<br>they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the<br>nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.<br><br>Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to<br>pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only<br>thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,<br>perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to<br>drift ashore.<br><br>Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon<br>the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,<br>and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to<br>the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of<br>paper.<br><br>It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making<br>desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a<br>way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to<br>some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised<br>her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her<br>nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for<br>though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her. I<br>can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was<br>melted because he had all his first teeth.<br><br>She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her<br>what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood<br>the other's language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds<br>freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a<br>story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but<br>truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,<br>not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their<br>manners.<br><br>"I--want--you--to--get--into--the--nest," the bird called, speaking as<br>slowly and distinctly as possible, "and--then--you--can--drift--ashore,<br>but--I--am--too--tired--to--bring--it--any--nearer--so--you--must--try<br>to--swim--to--it."<br><br>"What are you quacking about?" Peter answered. "Why don't you let the<br>nest drift as usual?"<br><br>"I--want--you--" the bird said, and repeated it all over.<br><br>Then Peter tried slow and distinct.<br><br>"What--are--you--quacking--about?" and so on.<br><br>The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.<br><br>"You dunderheaded little jay," she screamed, "Why don't you do as I tell<br>you?"<br><br>Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted<br>hotly:<br><br>"So are you!"<br><br>Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:<br><br>"Shut up!"<br><br>"Shut up!"<br><br>Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by<br>one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up<br>she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.<br><br>Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks<br>to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks,<br>however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him<br>get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.<br><br>There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected.<br>The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of<br>them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.<br><br>I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,<br>driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried<br>treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in<br>a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls<br>and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and<br>then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon<br>them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a<br>deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into<br>this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.<br><br>The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her<br>admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then<br>he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his<br>shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the<br>hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,<br>and he was borne off in another, both cheering.<br><br>Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque [small ship, actually<br>the Never Bird's nest in this particular case in point] in a place where<br>the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that<br>she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and<br>often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter<br>feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her<br>again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build<br>in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an<br>airing.<br><br>Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground<br>almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by<br>the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest<br>adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so<br>inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still<br>longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having<br>them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of<br>the hour, and cried, "To bed, to bed," in a voice that had to be obeyed.<br>Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to<br>every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying<br>their arms in slings.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 10.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 10. THE HAPPY HOME<br><br>One important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was<br>that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from<br>a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not<br>do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under<br>the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously<br>could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking<br>the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.<br><br>They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves [lying<br>down] before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not<br>really good for him.<br><br>"The great white father," he would say to them in a very lordly manner,<br>as they grovelled at his feet, "is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors<br>protecting his wigwam from the pirates."<br><br>"Me Tiger Lily," that lovely creature would reply. "Peter Pan save me,<br>me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him."<br><br>She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his<br>due, and he would answer condescendingly, "It is good. Peter Pan has<br>spoken."<br><br>Always when he said, "Peter Pan has spoken," it meant that they must now<br>shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by<br>no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just<br>ordinary braves. They said "How-do?" to them, and things like that; and<br>what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.<br><br>Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal<br>a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. "Father knows<br>best," she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her<br>private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.<br><br>We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the<br>Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as<br>if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the<br>redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the<br>children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone<br>out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find<br>the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.<br><br>The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the<br>board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and<br>recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.<br>To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them<br>grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had<br>pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back<br>at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising<br>the right arm politely and saying, "I complain of so-and-so;" but what<br>usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.<br><br>"Silence," cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them<br>that they were not all to speak at once. "Is your mug empty, Slightly<br>darling?"<br><br>"Not quite empty, mummy," Slightly said, after looking into an imaginary<br>mug.<br><br>"He hasn't even begun to drink his milk," Nibs interposed.<br><br>This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.<br><br>"I complain of Nibs," he cried promptly.<br><br>John, however, had held up his hand first.<br><br>"Well, John?"<br><br>"May I sit in Peter's chair, as he is not here?"<br><br>"Sit in father's chair, John!" Wendy was scandalised. "Certainly not."<br><br>"He is not really our father," John answered. "He didn't even know how a<br>father does till I showed him."<br><br>This was grumbling. "We complain of John," cried the twins.<br><br>Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he<br>was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.<br><br>"I don't suppose," Tootles said diffidently [bashfully or timidly],<br>"that I could be father."<br><br>"No, Tootles."<br><br>Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of<br>going on.<br><br>"As I can't be father," he said heavily, "I don't suppose, Michael, you<br>would let me be baby?"<br><br>"No, I won't," Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.<br><br>"As I can't be baby," Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and<br>heavier, "do you think I could be a twin?"<br><br>"No, indeed," replied the twins; "it's awfully difficult to be a twin."<br><br>"As I can't be anything important," said Tootles, "would any of you like<br>to see me do a trick?"<br><br>"No," they all replied.<br><br>Then at last he stopped. "I hadn't really any hope," he said.<br><br>The hateful telling broke out again.<br><br>"Slightly is coughing on the table."<br><br>"The twins began with cheese-cakes."<br><br>"Curly is taking both butter and honey."<br><br>"Nibs is speaking with his mouth full."<br><br>"I complain of the twins."<br><br>"I complain of Curly."<br><br>"I complain of Nibs."<br><br>"Oh dear, oh dear," cried Wendy, "I'm sure I sometimes think that<br>spinsters are to be envied."<br><br>She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy<br>load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.<br><br>"Wendy," remonstrated [scolded] Michael, "I'm too big for a cradle."<br><br>"I must have somebody in a cradle," she said almost tartly, "and you<br>are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a<br>house."<br><br>While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces<br>and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very<br>familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking<br>on it for the last time.<br><br>There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to<br>recognize it.<br><br>"Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him at the<br>door."<br><br>Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.<br><br>"Watch well, braves. I have spoken."<br><br>And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his<br>tree. As so often before, but never again.<br><br>He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.<br><br>"Peter, you just spoil them, you know," Wendy simpered [exaggerated a<br>smile].<br><br>"Ah, old lady," said Peter, hanging up his gun.<br><br>"It was me told him mothers are called old lady," Michael whispered to<br>Curly.<br><br>"I complain of Michael," said Curly instantly.<br><br>The first twin came to Peter. "Father, we want to dance."<br><br>"Dance away, my little man," said Peter, who was in high good humour.<br><br>"But we want you to dance."<br><br>Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be<br>scandalised.<br><br>"Me! My old bones would rattle!"<br><br>"And mummy too."<br><br>"What," cried Wendy, "the mother of such an armful, dance!"<br><br>"But on a Saturday night," Slightly insinuated.<br><br>It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for<br>they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do<br>anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did<br>it.<br><br>"Of course it is Saturday night, Peter," Wendy said, relenting.<br><br>"People of our figure, Wendy!"<br><br>"But it is only among our own progeny [children]."<br><br>"True, true."<br><br>So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties<br>first.<br><br>"Ah, old lady," Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire<br>and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, "there is nothing<br>more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day's toil is over<br>than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by."<br><br>"It is sweet, Peter, isn't it?" Wendy said, frightfully gratified.<br>"Peter, I think Curly has your nose."<br><br>"Michael takes after you."<br><br>She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.<br><br>"Dear Peter," she said, "with such a large family, of course, I have now<br>passed my best, but you don't want to [ex]change me, do you?"<br><br>"No, Wendy."<br><br>Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,<br>blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.<br><br>"Peter, what is it?"<br><br>"I was just thinking," he said, a little scared. "It is only<br>make-believe, isn't it, that I am their father?"<br><br>"Oh yes," Wendy said primly [formally and properly].<br><br>"You see," he continued apologetically, "it would make me seem so old to<br>be their real father."<br><br>"But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine."<br><br>"But not really, Wendy?" he asked anxiously.<br><br>"Not if you don't wish it," she replied; and she distinctly heard his<br>sigh of relief. "Peter," she asked, trying to speak firmly, "what are<br>your exact feelings to [about] me?"<br><br>"Those of a devoted son, Wendy."<br><br>"I thought so," she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme end<br>of the room.<br><br>"You are so queer," he said, frankly puzzled, "and Tiger Lily is just<br>the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is<br>not my mother."<br><br>"No, indeed, it is not," Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we<br>know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.<br><br>"Then what is it?"<br><br>"It isn't for a lady to tell."<br><br>"Oh, very well," Peter said, a little nettled. "Perhaps Tinker Bell will<br>tell me."<br><br>"Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you," Wendy retorted scornfully. "She is<br>an abandoned little creature."<br><br>Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something<br>impudent.<br><br>"She says she glories in being abandoned," Peter interpreted.<br><br>He had a sudden idea. "Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?"<br><br>"You silly ass!" cried Tinker Bell in a passion.<br><br>She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.<br><br>"I almost agree with her," Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she<br>had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the<br>night was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.<br><br>None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance<br>gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the<br>island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They<br>sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song<br>it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows,<br>little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom<br>they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and<br>how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow<br>fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows<br>insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never<br>meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's<br>good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but<br>the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others<br>but himself, and he said happily:<br><br>"Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the end."<br><br>And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they<br>loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this<br>story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if<br>he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on<br>the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what<br>happened.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 11.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 11. WENDY'S STORY<br><br>"Listen, then," said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at<br>her feet and seven boys in the bed. "There was once a gentleman--"<br><br>"I had rather he had been a lady," Curly said.<br><br>"I wish he had been a white rat," said Nibs.<br><br>"Quiet," their mother admonished [cautioned] them. "There was a lady<br>also, and--"<br><br>"Oh, mummy," cried the first twin, "you mean that there is a lady also,<br>don't you? She is not dead, is she?"<br><br>"Oh, no."<br><br>"I am awfully glad she isn't dead," said Tootles. "Are you glad, John?"<br><br>"Of course I am."<br><br>"Are you glad, Nibs?"<br><br>"Rather."<br><br>"Are you glad, Twins?"<br><br>"We are glad."<br><br>"Oh dear," sighed Wendy.<br><br>"Little less noise there," Peter called out, determined that she should<br>have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.<br><br>"The gentleman's name," Wendy continued, "was Mr. Darling, and her name<br>was Mrs. Darling."<br><br>"I knew them," John said, to annoy the others.<br><br>"I think I knew them," said Michael rather doubtfully.<br><br>"They were married, you know," explained Wendy, "and what do you think<br>they had?"<br><br>"White rats," cried Nibs, inspired.<br><br>"No."<br><br>"It's awfully puzzling," said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.<br><br>"Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants."<br><br>"What is descendants?"<br><br>"Well, you are one, Twin."<br><br>"Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant."<br><br>"Descendants are only children," said John.<br><br>"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Wendy. "Now these three children had a<br>faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and<br>chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away."<br><br>"It's an awfully good story," said Nibs.<br><br>"They flew away," Wendy continued, "to the Neverland, where the lost<br>children are."<br><br>"I just thought they did," Curly broke in excitedly. "I don't know how<br>it is, but I just thought they did!"<br><br>"O Wendy," cried Tootles, "was one of the lost children called Tootles?"<br><br>"Yes, he was."<br><br>"I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs."<br><br>"Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents<br>with all their children flown away."<br><br>"Oo!" they all moaned, though they were not really considering the<br>feelings of the unhappy parents one jot.<br><br>"Think of the empty beds!"<br><br>"Oo!"<br><br>"It's awfully sad," the first twin said cheerfully.<br><br>"I don't see how it can have a happy ending," said the second twin. "Do<br>you, Nibs?"<br><br>"I'm frightfully anxious."<br><br>"If you knew how great is a mother's love," Wendy told them<br>triumphantly, "you would have no fear." She had now come to the part<br>that Peter hated.<br><br>"I do like a mother's love," said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.<br>"Do you like a mother's love, Nibs?"<br><br>"I do just," said Nibs, hitting back.<br><br>"You see," Wendy said complacently, "our heroine knew that the mother<br>would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so<br>they stayed away for years and had a lovely time."<br><br>"Did they ever go back?"<br><br>"Let us now," said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,<br>"take a peep into the future;" and they all gave themselves the twist<br>that makes peeps into the future easier. "Years have rolled by, and who<br>is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?"<br><br>"O Wendy, who is she?" cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn't<br>know.<br><br>"Can it be--yes--no--it is--the fair Wendy!"<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>"And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to<br>man's estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!"<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>"'See, dear brothers,' says Wendy pointing upwards, 'there is the window<br>still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a<br>mother's love.' So up they flew to their mummy and daddy, and pen cannot<br>describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil."<br><br>That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair<br>narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip<br>like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are,<br>but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when<br>we have need of special attention we nobly return for it, confident that<br>we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.<br><br>So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they felt they<br>could afford to be callous for a bit longer.<br><br>But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he<br>uttered a hollow groan.<br><br>"What is it, Peter?" she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill. She<br>felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. "Where is it, Peter?"<br><br>"It isn't that kind of pain," Peter replied darkly.<br><br>"Then what kind is it?"<br><br>"Wendy, you are wrong about mothers."<br><br>They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;<br>and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.<br><br>"Long ago," he said, "I thought like you that my mother would always<br>keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and<br>moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had<br>forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my<br>bed."<br><br>I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it<br>scared them.<br><br>"Are you sure mothers are like that?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!<br><br>Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child<br>when he should give in. "Wendy, let us [let's] go home," cried John and<br>Michael together.<br><br>"Yes," she said, clutching them.<br><br>"Not to-night?" asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they<br>called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and<br>that it is only the mothers who think you can't.<br><br>"At once," Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come<br>to her: "Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time."<br><br>This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter's feelings, and<br>she said to him rather sharply, "Peter, will you make the necessary<br>arrangements?"<br><br>"If you wish it," he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass<br>the nuts.<br><br>Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind the<br>parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.<br><br>But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against<br>grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he<br>got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the<br>rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in<br>the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter<br>was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.<br><br>Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned<br>to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence.<br>Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced<br>upon her threateningly.<br><br>"It will be worse than before she came," they cried.<br><br>"We shan't let her go."<br><br>"Let's keep her prisoner."<br><br>"Ay, chain her up."<br><br>In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.<br><br>"Tootles," she cried, "I appeal to you."<br><br>Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.<br><br>Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped<br>his silliness and spoke with dignity.<br><br>"I am just Tootles," he said, "and nobody minds me. But the first who<br>does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him<br>severely."<br><br>He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The<br>others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once<br>that they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the<br>Neverland against her will.<br><br>"Wendy," he said, striding up and down, "I have asked the redskins to<br>guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so."<br><br>"Thank you, Peter."<br><br>"Then," he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be<br>obeyed, "Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs."<br><br>Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really<br>been sitting up in bed listening for some time.<br><br>"Who are you? How dare you? Go away," she cried.<br><br>"You are to get up, Tink," Nibs called, "and take Wendy on a journey."<br><br>Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but<br>she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in<br>still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.<br><br>"She says she won't!" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,<br>whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.<br><br>"Tink," he rapped out, "if you don't get up and dress at once I will<br>open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligee<br>[nightgown]."<br><br>This made her leap to the floor. "Who said I wasn't getting up?" she<br>cried.<br><br>In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now<br>equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were<br>dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also<br>because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they<br>had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.<br><br>Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.<br><br>"Dear ones," she said, "if you will all come with me I feel almost sure<br>I can get my father and mother to adopt you."<br><br>The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was<br>thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.<br><br>"But won't they think us rather a handful?" Nibs asked in the middle of<br>his jump.<br><br>"Oh no," said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, "it will only mean having<br>a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on<br>first Thursdays."<br><br>"Peter, can we go?" they all cried imploringly. They took it for granted<br>that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared. Thus<br>children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest<br>ones.<br><br>"All right," Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they<br>rushed to get their things.<br><br>"And now, Peter," Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right,<br>"I am going to give you your medicine before you go." She loved to give<br>them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only<br>water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and<br>counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this<br>occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for<br>just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her<br>heart sink.<br><br>"Get your things, Peter," she cried, shaking.<br><br>"No," he answered, pretending indifference, "I am not going with you,<br>Wendy."<br><br>"Yes, Peter."<br><br>"No."<br><br>To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and<br>down the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run<br>about after him, though it was rather undignified.<br><br>"To find your mother," she coaxed.<br><br>Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He<br>could do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered<br>only their bad points.<br><br>"No, no," he told Wendy decisively; "perhaps she would say I was old,<br>and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun."<br><br>"But, Peter--"<br><br>"No."<br><br>And so the others had to be told.<br><br>"Peter isn't coming."<br><br>Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their<br>backs, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter<br>was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go.<br><br>But he was far too proud for that. "If you find your mothers," he said<br>darkly, "I hope you will like them."<br><br>The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most<br>of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were<br>they not noodles to want to go?<br><br>"Now then," cried Peter, "no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;" and<br>he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for<br>he had something important to do.<br><br>She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would<br>prefer a thimble.<br><br>"You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?" she said,<br>lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And you will take your medicine?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,<br>however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. "Are you<br>ready, Tinker Bell?" he called out.<br><br>"Ay, ay."<br><br>"Then lead the way."<br><br>Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was<br>at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the<br>redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with<br>shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths<br>opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were<br>extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly<br>blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert<br>them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had<br>slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 12.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 12. THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF<br><br>The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the<br>unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins<br>fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.<br><br>By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who<br>attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the<br>dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its<br>lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on<br>the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream<br>runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await<br>the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and<br>treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just<br>before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle,<br>snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood<br>closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.<br>Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful<br>imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other<br>braves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not<br>very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is<br>horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first<br>time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier<br>silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.<br><br>That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in<br>disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.<br><br>The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and<br>their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.<br>They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of<br>their tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the<br>marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were<br>on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in<br>an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of<br>ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the<br>home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their<br>mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a<br>stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish<br>himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped<br>out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded<br>their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to<br>them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children's home, awaiting<br>the cold moment when they should deal pale death.<br><br>Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which<br>they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found<br>by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such<br>of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have<br>paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that grey<br>light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears<br>from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would not even<br>hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with no policy<br>but to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do,<br>masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot<br>helplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they<br>gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.<br><br>Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and<br>they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell<br>from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at<br>victory. No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy<br>hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father's sons they<br>acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx<br>[dense formation] that would have been hard to break had they risen<br>quickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their<br>race. It is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in<br>the presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the<br>pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,<br>not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed,<br>the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air<br>was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.<br><br>It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a<br>fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all<br>unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb<br>the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust were Geo.<br>Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the<br>tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way through the<br>pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.<br><br>To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for<br>the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the<br>proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in<br>judging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should<br>perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to<br>follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element<br>of surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the whole<br>question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a<br>reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,<br>and the fell [deadly] genius with which it was carried out.<br><br>What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?<br>Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping<br>their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and<br>squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation<br>must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a<br>dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as<br>in substance.<br><br>The night's work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had<br>come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he<br>should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their<br>band, but chiefly Pan.<br><br>Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's hatred<br>of him. True he had flung Hook's arm to the crocodile, but even this<br>and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to<br>the crocodile's pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a<br>vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was<br>a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It<br>was not his courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not--.<br>There is no beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was,<br>and have got to tell. It was Peter's cockiness.<br><br>This had got on Hook's nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at<br>night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured<br>man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.<br><br>The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs<br>down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest<br>ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple<br>[hesitate] to ram them down with poles.<br><br>In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang<br>of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed,<br>all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as<br>their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium<br>above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce<br>gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their<br>fate.<br><br>Which side had won?<br><br>The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the<br>question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter's answer.<br><br>"If the redskins have won," he said, "they will beat the tom-tom; it is<br>always their sign of victory."<br><br>Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.<br>"You will never hear the tom-tom again," he muttered, but inaudibly of<br>course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To his amazement<br>Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an<br>understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,<br>had this simple man admired Hook so much.<br><br>Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen<br>gleefully.<br><br>"The tom-tom," the miscreants heard Peter cry; "an Indian victory!"<br><br>The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black<br>hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes<br>to Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were<br>swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the<br>trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and<br>silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to<br>arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 13.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 13. DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?<br><br>The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to<br>emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of<br>Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to<br>Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to<br>another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were<br>plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them<br>were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.<br><br>A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With<br>ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his<br>arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He<br>did it with such an air, he was so frightfully DISTINGUE [imposingly<br>distinguished], that she was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a<br>little girl.<br><br>Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her,<br>and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she<br>haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her),<br>she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then<br>Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children;<br>and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly's<br>secret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul<br>attempt on Peter's life.<br><br>They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees<br>close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had<br>cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly's turn<br>came, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up<br>all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to<br>tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the<br>parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange<br>to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence. His lip was<br>curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating<br>because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one<br>part he bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath<br>Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his<br>exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills,<br>knew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which was this,<br>that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need<br>stick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he<br>was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly<br>addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in<br>consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit<br>his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit<br>him.<br><br>Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay<br>at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the<br>subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed<br>that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be<br>alone.<br><br>How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be<br>rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.<br>Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the<br>little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into<br>it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in<br>behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession<br>set off through the wood. I don't know whether any of the children were<br>crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house<br>disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from<br>its chimney as if defying Hook.<br><br>Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of<br>pity for him that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast.<br><br>The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling<br>night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that it provided<br>him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill<br>omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play<br>refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes<br>were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound from<br>the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under<br>the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void. Was<br>that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree,<br>with his dagger in his hand?<br><br>There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip<br>softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood<br>on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment<br>he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a<br>candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.<br><br>He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,<br>biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became<br>accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees<br>took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long<br>sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter<br>fast asleep.<br><br>Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for<br>a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no<br>doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care.<br>Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he<br>lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she<br>had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may<br>not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but<br>it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he<br>laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.<br><br>Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful<br>than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from<br>these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I<br>think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been<br>Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,<br>soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer<br>to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should<br>not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this<br>occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped<br>over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of<br>his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little<br>pearls.<br><br>Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree<br>looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion<br>disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers<br>(I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on<br>the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of<br>the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would<br>have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.<br><br>What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept. The<br>open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a<br>personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one<br>may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They<br>steeled Hook's heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces<br>every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the<br>sleeper.<br><br>Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in<br>darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered<br>an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree. It did not entirely fill the<br>aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch,<br>he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his<br>disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's<br>face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung<br>himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?<br><br>But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's<br>medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was<br>straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.<br><br>Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a<br>dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that<br>had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow<br>liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent<br>poison in existence.<br><br>Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook, but it<br>was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing<br>at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid<br>spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and<br>turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged<br>at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.<br>Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him,<br>holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night,<br>of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself,<br>stole away through the trees.<br><br>Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out,<br>leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been<br>not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in<br>his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on<br>the door of his tree.<br><br>Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for<br>his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.<br><br>"Who is that?"<br><br>For long there was no answer: then again the knock.<br><br>"Who are you?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached<br>the door. Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture [opening], so<br>that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.<br><br>"I won't open unless you speak," Peter cried.<br><br>Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.<br><br>"Let me in, Peter."<br><br>It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her<br>face flushed and her dress stained with mud.<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"Oh, you could never guess!" she cried, and offered him three guesses.<br>"Out with it!" he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as<br>the ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from their mouths, she told<br>of the capture of Wendy and the boys.<br><br>Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the<br>pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!<br><br>"I'll rescue her!" he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he<br>thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his<br>medicine.<br><br>His hand closed on the fatal draught.<br><br>"No!" shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as<br>he sped through the forest.<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"It is poisoned."<br><br>"Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?"<br><br>"Hook."<br><br>"Don't be silly. How could Hook have got down here?"<br><br>Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the<br>dark secret of Slightly's tree. Nevertheless Hook's words had left no<br>room for doubt. The cup was poisoned.<br><br>"Besides," said Peter, quite believing himself "I never fell asleep."<br><br>He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one<br>of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,<br>and drained it to the dregs.<br><br>"Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?"<br><br>But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.<br><br>"What is the matter with you?" cried Peter, suddenly afraid.<br><br>"It was poisoned, Peter," she told him softly; "and now I am going to be<br>dead."<br><br>"O Tink, did you drink it to save me?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"But why, Tink?"<br><br>Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his<br>shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear "You<br>silly ass," and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.<br><br>His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt<br>near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and<br>he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears so<br>much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.<br><br>Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.<br>Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well<br>again if children believed in fairies.<br><br>Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night<br>time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and<br>who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their<br>nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.<br><br>"Do you believe?" he cried.<br><br>Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.<br><br>She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she<br>wasn't sure.<br><br>"What do you think?" she asked Peter.<br><br>"If you believe," he shouted to them, "clap your hands; don't let Tink<br>die."<br><br>Many clapped.<br><br>Some didn't.<br><br>A few beasts hissed.<br><br>The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to<br>their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was<br>saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then<br>she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. She<br>never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have like to<br>get at the ones who had hissed.<br><br>"And now to rescue Wendy!"<br><br>The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,<br>begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon<br>his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen.<br>He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing<br>unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have<br>flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus<br>disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.<br><br>He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange<br>names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.<br><br>There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at<br>which happily he was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for he<br>could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A<br>light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence<br>pervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of<br>the recent carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest<br>lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell,<br>and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it.<br>Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the<br>trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her<br>handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search<br>for such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world had called<br>him, but would give no help.<br><br>The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not<br>a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next<br>tree, or stalking him from behind.<br><br>He swore this terrible oath: "Hook or me this time."<br><br>Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across<br>a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his<br>dagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 14.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 14. THE PIRATE SHIP<br><br>One green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is near the mouth of<br>the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in<br>the water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull,<br>every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers.<br>She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye,<br>for she floated immune in the horror of her name.<br><br>She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her<br>could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable<br>save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever<br>industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee.<br>I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because<br>he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn<br>hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he<br>had touched the fount of Hook's tears and made it flow. Of this, as of<br>almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.<br><br>A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma<br>[putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of<br>dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house<br>lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully<br>to this side or that out of Hook's reach, lest he should claw them<br>mechanically in passing.<br><br>Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of<br>triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the<br>other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his<br>grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and<br>knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised<br>had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his<br>success?<br><br>But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of<br>his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.<br><br>He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the<br>quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This<br>inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.<br>They were socially inferior to him.<br><br>Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at<br>this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the<br>lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;<br>and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed<br>they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to<br>board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [attacked] her, and<br>he still adhered in his walk to the school's distinguished slouch. But<br>above all he retained the passion for good form.<br><br>Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this<br>is all that really matters.<br><br>From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through<br>them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one<br>cannot sleep. "Have you been good form to-day?" was their eternal<br>question.<br><br>"Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine," he cried.<br><br>"Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?" the tap-tap<br>from his school replied.<br><br>"I am the only man whom Barbecue feared," he urged, "and Flint feared<br>Barbecue."<br><br>"Barbecue, Flint--what house?" came the cutting retort.<br><br>Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about<br>good form?<br><br>His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him<br>sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped<br>down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he<br>drew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.<br><br>Ah, envy not Hook.<br><br>There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [death]. It<br>was as if Peter's terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy<br>desire to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time<br>for it.<br><br>"Better for Hook," he cried, "if he had had less ambition!" It was in<br>his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.<br><br>"No little children to love me!"<br><br>Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him<br>before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he<br>muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under<br>the conviction that all children feared him.<br><br>Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that<br>night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them<br>and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with<br>his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on<br>his spectacles.<br><br>To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,<br>but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his<br>mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the<br>sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him<br>so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself--"Good form?"<br><br>Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of<br>all?<br><br>He remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it before<br>you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].<br><br>With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee's head; but he did<br>not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:<br><br>"To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?"<br><br>"Bad form!"<br><br>The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and he fell<br>forward like a cut flower.<br><br>His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly<br>relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which<br>brought him to his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as<br>if a bucket of water had passed over him.<br><br>"Quiet, you scugs," he cried, "or I'll cast anchor in you;" and at once<br>the din was hushed. "Are all the children chained, so that they cannot<br>fly away?"<br><br>"Ay, ay."<br><br>"Then hoist them up."<br><br>The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,<br>and ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious<br>of their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,<br>snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon<br>the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.<br><br>"Now then, bullies," he said briskly, "six of you walk the plank<br>to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?"<br><br>"Don't irritate him unnecessarily," had been Wendy's instructions in<br>the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea<br>of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would<br>be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a<br>somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be<br>the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for<br>it, but make constant use of it.<br><br>So Tootles explained prudently, "You see, sir, I don't think my mother<br>would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,<br>Slightly?"<br><br>He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, "I don't think so," as if<br>he wished things had been otherwise. "Would your mother like you to be a<br>pirate, Twin?"<br><br>"I don't think so," said the first twin, as clever as the others. "Nibs,<br>would--"<br><br>"Stow this gab," roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. "You,<br>boy," he said, addressing John, "you look as if you had a little pluck<br>in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?"<br><br>Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and<br>he was struck by Hook's picking him out.<br><br>"I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack," he said diffidently.<br><br>"And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join."<br><br>"What do you think, Michael?" asked John.<br><br>"What would you call me if I join?" Michael demanded.<br><br>"Blackbeard Joe."<br><br>Michael was naturally impressed. "What do you think, John?" He wanted<br>John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.<br><br>"Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?" John inquired.<br><br>Through Hook's teeth came the answer: "You would have to swear, 'Down<br>with the King.'"<br><br>Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.<br><br>"Then I refuse," he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.<br><br>"And I refuse," cried Michael.<br><br>"Rule Britannia!" squeaked Curly.<br><br>The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,<br>"That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready."<br><br>They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco<br>preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was<br>brought up.<br><br>No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the<br>boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that<br>she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not<br>a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with<br>your finger "Dirty pig"; and she had already written it on several. But<br>as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for<br>them.<br><br>"So, my beauty," said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, "you are to see<br>your children walk the plank."<br><br>Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled<br>his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty<br>gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.<br><br>"Are they to die?" asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt<br>that he nearly fainted.<br><br>"They are," he snarled. "Silence all," he called gloatingly, "for a<br>mother's last words to her children."<br><br>At this moment Wendy was grand. "These are my last words, dear boys,"<br>she said firmly. "I feel that I have a message to you from your real<br>mothers, and it is this: 'We hope our sons will die like English<br>gentlemen.'"<br><br>Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, "I am<br>going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?"<br><br>"What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?"<br><br>"What my mother hopes. John, what are--"<br><br>But Hook had found his voice again.<br><br>"Tie her up!" he shouted.<br><br>It was Smee who tied her to the mast. "See here, honey," he whispered,<br>"I'll save you if you promise to be my mother."<br><br>But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. "I would almost<br>rather have no children at all," she said disdainfully [scornfully].<br><br>It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to<br>the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they<br>were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would<br>walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they<br>could stare and shiver only.<br><br>Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy.<br>His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys<br>walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard<br>the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else<br>instead.<br><br>It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.<br><br>They all heard it--pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was<br>blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but<br>toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone,<br>and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.<br><br>Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if<br>he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.<br><br>The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly<br>thought, "The crocodile is about to board the ship!"<br><br>Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic<br>part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any<br>other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the<br>gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he<br>crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could<br>go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only<br>when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.<br><br>"Hide me!" he cried hoarsely.<br><br>They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming<br>aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.<br><br>Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of<br>the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile<br>climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of<br>Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid. It was<br>Peter.<br><br>He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might<br>rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 15.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 15. "HOOK OR ME THIS TIME"<br><br>Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our<br>noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,<br>we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don't know<br>how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that<br>night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island<br>with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the<br>crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by<br>and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought<br>this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.<br><br>Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a<br>fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter<br>began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use;<br>and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the<br>crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one<br>unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,<br>and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what<br>it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again<br>ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a<br>fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.<br><br>Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs<br>encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new<br>element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human<br>of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: "Hook or me this<br>time." He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing<br>that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board<br>the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred<br>to him.<br><br>On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a<br>mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook<br>in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.<br><br>The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the<br>ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile,<br>and he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it<br>himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. "How clever of me!"<br>he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.<br><br>It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the<br>forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by<br>your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the<br>ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.<br>Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the<br>carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How<br>long has it taken?<br><br>"One!" (Slightly had begun to count.)<br><br>None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the<br>cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look<br>round. They could hear each other's distressed breathing now, which<br>showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.<br><br>"It's gone, captain," Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. "All's still<br>again."<br><br>Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently<br>that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,<br>and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.<br><br>"Then here's to Johnny Plank!" he cried brazenly, hating the boys more<br>than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the villainous<br>ditty:<br><br>     "Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,<br>     You walks along it so,<br>     Till it goes down and you goes down<br>     To Davy Jones below!"<br><br>To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of<br>dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he<br>sang; and when he finished he cried, "Do you want a touch of the cat [o'<br>nine tails] before you walk the plank?"<br><br>At that they fell on their knees. "No, no!" they cried so piteously that<br>every pirate smiled.<br><br>"Fetch the cat, Jukes," said Hook; "it's in the cabin."<br><br>The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.<br><br>"Ay, ay," said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They<br>followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his<br>song, his dogs joining in with him:<br><br>     "Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,<br>     Its tails are nine, you know,<br>     And when they're writ upon your back--"<br><br>What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was<br>stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship,<br>and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood<br>by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.<br><br>"What was that?" cried Hook.<br><br>"Two," said Slightly solemnly.<br><br>The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.<br>He tottered out, haggard.<br><br>"What's the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?" hissed Hook, towering over<br>him.<br><br>"The matter wi' him is he's dead, stabbed," replied Cecco in a hollow<br>voice.<br><br>"Bill Jukes dead!" cried the startled pirates.<br><br>"The cabin's as black as a pit," Cecco said, almost gibbering, "but<br>there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing."<br><br>The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were<br>seen by Hook.<br><br>"Cecco," he said in his most steely voice, "go back and fetch me out<br>that doodle-doo."<br><br>Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying "No,<br>no"; but Hook was purring to his claw.<br><br>"Did you say you would go, Cecco?" he said musingly.<br><br>Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more<br>singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a<br>crow.<br><br>No one spoke except Slightly. "Three," he said.<br><br>Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. "'S'death and odds fish," he<br>thundered, "who is to bring me that doodle-doo?"<br><br>"Wait till Cecco comes out," growled Starkey, and the others took up the<br>cry.<br><br>"I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey," said Hook, purring again.<br><br>"No, by thunder!" Starkey cried.<br><br>"My hook thinks you did," said Hook, crossing to him. "I wonder if it<br>would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?"<br><br>"I'll swing before I go in there," replied Starkey doggedly, and again<br>he had the support of the crew.<br><br>"Is this mutiny?" asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. "Starkey's<br>ringleader!"<br><br>"Captain, mercy!" Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.<br><br>"Shake hands, Starkey," said Hook, proffering his claw.<br><br>Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up<br>Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing<br>scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the<br>sea.<br><br>"Four," said Slightly.<br><br>"And now," Hook said courteously, "did any other gentlemen say mutiny?"<br>Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, "I'll<br>bring out that doodle-doo myself," he said, and sped into the cabin.<br><br>"Five." How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,<br>but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.<br><br>"Something blew out the light," he said a little unsteadily.<br><br>"Something!" echoed Mullins.<br><br>"What of Cecco?" demanded Noodler.<br><br>"He's as dead as Jukes," said Hook shortly.<br><br>His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,<br>and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are<br>superstitious, and Cookson cried, "They do say the surest sign a ship's<br>accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for."<br><br>"I've heard," muttered Mullins, "he always boards the pirate craft last.<br>Had he a tail, captain?"<br><br>"They say," said another, looking viciously at Hook, "that when he comes<br>it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard."<br><br>"Had he a hook, captain?" asked Cookson insolently; and one after<br>another took up the cry, "The ship's doomed!" At this the children could<br>not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners,<br>but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.<br><br>"Lads," he cried to his crew, "now here's a notion. Open the cabin door<br>and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If<br>they kill him, we're so much the better; if he kills them, we're none<br>the worse."<br><br>For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his<br>bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin<br>and the door was closed on them.<br><br>"Now, listen!" cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face<br>the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.<br>It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for<br>the reappearance of Peter.<br><br>She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which<br>he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their<br>manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they<br>could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy's bonds,<br>and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off<br>together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, "Hook or me this time."<br>So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal herself with<br>the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him<br>so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.<br><br>To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the<br>cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but<br>like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew<br>that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.<br><br>"Lads," he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never<br>quailing for an instant, "I've thought it out. There's a Jonah aboard."<br><br>"Ay," they snarled, "a man wi' a hook."<br><br>"No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi' a<br>woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone."<br><br>Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint's. "It's<br>worth trying," they said doubtfully.<br><br>"Fling the girl overboard," cried Hook; and they made a rush at the<br>figure in the cloak.<br><br>"There's none can save you now, missy," Mullins hissed jeeringly.<br><br>"There's one," replied the figure.<br><br>"Who's that?"<br><br>"Peter Pan the avenger!" came the terrible answer; and as he spoke Peter<br>flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who 'twas that had been undoing<br>them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.<br>In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.<br><br>At last he cried, "Cleave him to the brisket!" but without conviction.<br><br>"Down, boys, and at them!" Peter's voice rang out; and in another moment<br>the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept<br>together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came<br>when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking<br>wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man<br>they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which<br>enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the<br>miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they<br>were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern<br>which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and<br>fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was<br>little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional<br>screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven<br>eight--nine--ten--eleven.<br><br>I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who<br>seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle<br>of fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a<br>match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and<br>again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,<br>and was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just<br>passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.<br><br>"Put up your swords, boys," cried the newcomer, "this man is mine."<br><br>Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others<br>drew back and formed a ring around them.<br><br>For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering<br>slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.<br><br>"So, Pan," said Hook at last, "this is all your doing."<br><br>"Ay, James Hook," came the stern answer, "it is all my doing."<br><br>"Proud and insolent youth," said Hook, "prepare to meet thy doom."<br><br>"Dark and sinister man," Peter answered, "have at thee."<br><br>Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage<br>to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling<br>rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got<br>past his foe's defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead,<br>and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in<br>brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by<br>the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite<br>thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment<br>he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to<br>close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had<br>been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,<br>pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar<br>colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook's<br>hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.<br><br>"Now!" cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited<br>his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a<br>tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.<br><br>Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker<br>suspicions assailed him now.<br><br>"Pan, who and what art thou?" he cried huskily.<br><br>"I'm youth, I'm joy," Peter answered at a venture, "I'm a little bird<br>that has broken out of the egg."<br><br>This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that<br>Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very<br>pinnacle of good form.<br><br>"To't again," he cried despairingly.<br><br>He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword<br>would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter<br>fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the<br>danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.<br><br>Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer<br>asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form<br>before it was cold forever.<br><br>Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.<br><br>"In two minutes," he cried, "the ship will be blown to pieces."<br><br>Now, now, he thought, true form will show.<br><br>But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,<br>and calmly flung it overboard.<br><br>What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was,<br>we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was<br>true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying around<br>him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up<br>at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching<br>in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster]<br>for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes<br>were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his<br>socks were right.<br><br>James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.<br><br>For we have come to his last moment.<br><br>Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger<br>poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He<br>did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely<br>stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark<br>of respect from us at the end.<br><br>He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he<br>stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through<br>the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter<br>kick instead of stab.<br><br>At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.<br><br>"Bad form," he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.<br><br>Thus perished James Hook.<br><br>"Seventeen," Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his<br>figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two<br>reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him<br>nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and<br>Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making<br>a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had<br>feared.<br><br>Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though<br>watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she<br>became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered<br>delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;<br>and then she took them into Hook's cabin and pointed to his watch which<br>was hanging on a nail. It said "half-past one!"<br><br>The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got<br>them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all<br>but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell<br>asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and<br>cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 16.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 16. THE RETURN HOME<br><br>By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps [legs];<br>for there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo'sun, was among<br>them, with a rope's end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned<br>pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with<br>the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.<br><br>It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and<br>second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars [sailors]<br>before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle. Peter had already lashed<br>himself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short<br>address to them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant<br>hearties, but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast,<br>and if they snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words<br>struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then<br>a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed<br>her for the mainland.<br><br>Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that if this<br>weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,<br>after which it would save time to fly.<br><br>Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour<br>of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they<br>dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin [one person<br>after another, as they had to Cpt. Hook]. Instant obedience was the only<br>safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take<br>soundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to<br>lull Wendy's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new<br>suit was ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of<br>some of Hook's wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among<br>them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin<br>with Hook's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for<br>the forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.<br><br>Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that<br>desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless<br>flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this<br>time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we<br>had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would<br>probably have cried, "Don't be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and<br>keep an eye on the children." So long as mothers are like this their<br>children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to [bet on] that.<br><br>Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful<br>occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance<br>of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.<br>Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why<br>on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them<br>in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well right if<br>they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end<br>in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in need<br>of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs.<br>Darling would never forgive us.<br><br>One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the<br>way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they<br>will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the<br>surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They<br>have been planning it out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout<br>of joy, Nana's leap through the air to embrace them first, when what<br>they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil<br>it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly<br>Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may<br>exclaim pettishly, "Dash it all, here are those boys again." However,<br>we should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.<br>Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for<br>depriving the children of their little pleasure.<br><br>"But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by<br>telling you what's what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness."<br><br>"Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of<br>delight."<br><br>"Oh, if you look at it in that way!"<br><br>"What other way is there in which to look at it?"<br><br>You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say<br>extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of<br>them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have things<br>ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never leaves<br>the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we are to<br>her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may<br>as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really<br>wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of<br>them will hurt.<br><br>The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine<br>and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.<br>Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained<br>Nana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of<br>course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have<br>passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off;<br>but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what<br>seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care<br>after the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled<br>into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling's dear invitations to him to come<br>out he replied sadly but firmly:<br><br>"No, my own one, this is the place for me."<br><br>In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave<br>the kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but<br>whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave<br>up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud<br>George Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his<br>wife of their children and all their pretty ways.<br><br>Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into<br>the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.<br><br>Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,<br>which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way<br>at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen<br>if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this<br>man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he<br>must have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when<br>the young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat<br>courteously to any lady who looked inside.<br><br>It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward<br>meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched.<br>Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it<br>to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class of papers,<br>and society invited him to dinner and added, "Do come in the kennel."<br><br>On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery<br>awaiting George's return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look<br>at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone<br>now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won't be able to say<br>nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy<br>children, she couldn't help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has<br>fallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost<br>withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a<br>pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like<br>her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep<br>that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the<br>window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are<br>on the way. Let's.<br><br>It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and<br>there is no one in the room but Nana.<br><br>"O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back."<br><br>Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her<br>mistress's lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was<br>brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see<br>that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.<br><br>He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no<br>imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of<br>such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were<br>still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.<br><br>"Listen to them," he said; "it is very gratifying."<br><br>"Lots of little boys," sneered Liza.<br><br>"There were several adults to-day," he assured her with a faint flush;<br>but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.<br>Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some<br>time he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling<br>of this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she<br>hoped his head would not be turned by it.<br><br>"But if I had been a weak man," he said. "Good heavens, if I had been a<br>weak man!"<br><br>"And, George," she said timidly, "you are as full of remorse as ever,<br>aren't you?"<br><br>"Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a<br>kennel."<br><br>"But it is punishment, isn't it, George? You are sure you are not<br>enjoying it?"<br><br>"My love!"<br><br>You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he<br>curled round in the kennel.<br><br>"Won't you play me to sleep," he asked, "on the nursery piano?" and as<br>she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, "And shut<br>that window. I feel a draught."<br><br>"O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open<br>for them, always, always."<br><br>Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery<br>and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John<br>and Michael flew into the room.<br><br>Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement<br>planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have<br>happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter<br>and Tinker Bell.<br><br>Peter's first words tell all.<br><br>"Quick Tink," he whispered, "close the window; bar it! That's right. Now<br>you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think<br>her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me."<br><br>Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had<br>exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink<br>to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head<br>all the time.<br><br>Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then<br>he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to<br>Tink, "It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as<br>my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's<br>was."<br><br>Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes<br>bragged about her.<br><br>He did not know the tune, which was "Home, Sweet Home," but he knew it<br>was saying, "Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy"; and he cried exultantly,<br>"You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!"<br><br>He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw<br>that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were<br>sitting on her eyes.<br><br>"She wants me to unbar the window," thought Peter, "but I won't, not I!"<br><br>He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had<br>taken their place.<br><br>"She's awfully fond of Wendy," he said to himself. He was angry with her<br>now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.<br><br>The reason was so simple: "I'm fond of her too. We can't both have her,<br>lady."<br><br>But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He<br>ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He<br>skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as<br>if she were inside him, knocking.<br><br>"Oh, all right," he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the<br>window. "Come on, Tink," he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of<br>nature; "we don't want any silly mothers;" and he flew away.<br><br>Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after<br>all, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the<br>floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already<br>forgotten his home.<br><br>"John," he said, looking around him doubtfully, "I think I have been<br>here before."<br><br>"Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed."<br><br>"So it is," Michael said, but not with much conviction.<br><br>"I say," cried John, "the kennel!" and he dashed across to look into it.<br><br>"Perhaps Nana is inside it," Wendy said.<br><br>But John whistled. "Hullo," he said, "there's a man inside it."<br><br>"It's father!" exclaimed Wendy.<br><br>"Let me see father," Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.<br>"He is not so big as the pirate I killed," he said with such frank<br>disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been<br>sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.<br><br>Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in<br>the kennel.<br><br>"Surely," said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, "he used<br>not to sleep in the kennel?"<br><br>"John," Wendy said falteringly, "perhaps we don't remember the old life<br>as well as we thought we did."<br><br>A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.<br><br>"It is very careless of mother," said that young scoundrel John, "not to<br>be here when we come back."<br><br>It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.<br><br>"It's mother!" cried Wendy, peeping.<br><br>"So it is!" said John.<br><br>"Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?" asked Michael, who was<br>surely sleepy.<br><br>"Oh dear!" exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse [for<br>having gone], "it was quite time we came back."<br><br>"Let us creep in," John suggested, "and put our hands over her eyes."<br><br>But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had<br>a better plan.<br><br>"Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as<br>if we had never been away."<br><br>And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her<br>husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited<br>for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not<br>believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often in<br>her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her<br>still.<br><br>She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had<br>nursed them.<br><br>They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three<br>of them.<br><br>"Mother!" Wendy cried.<br><br>"That's Wendy," she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.<br><br>"Mother!"<br><br>"That's John," she said.<br><br>"Mother!" cried Michael. He knew her now.<br><br>"That's Michael," she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three<br>little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they did,<br>they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed<br>and run to her.<br><br>"George, George!" she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke<br>to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been<br>a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who<br>was staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that<br>other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at<br>the one joy from which he must be for ever barred.<br><br><br><br><br></p><p class='chapters'><a id='chapter' name='Chapter 17.' href='#to the top'>Chapter 17. WHEN WENDY GREW UP<br><br>I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting<br>below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had<br>counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because<br>they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in a row<br>in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not<br>wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their eyes asked<br>her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but<br>they forgot about him.<br><br>Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.<br>Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a<br>rather large number.<br><br>"I must say," he said to Wendy, "that you don't do things by halves," a<br>grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.<br><br>The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, "Do you think<br>we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go<br>away."<br><br>"Father!" Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew<br>he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.<br><br>"We could lie doubled up," said Nibs.<br><br>"I always cut their hair myself," said Wendy.<br><br>"George!" Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing<br>himself in such an unfavourable light.<br><br>Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to<br>have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his<br>consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher [zero] in<br>his own house.<br><br>"I don't think he is a cypher," Tootles cried instantly. "Do you think<br>he is a cypher, Curly?"<br><br>"No, I don't. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?"<br><br>"Rather not. Twin, what do you think?"<br><br>It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was<br>absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the<br>drawing-room if they fitted in.<br><br>"We'll fit in, sir," they assured him.<br><br>"Then follow the leader," he cried gaily. "Mind you, I am not sure that<br>we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same.<br>Hoop la!"<br><br>He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried "Hoop la!" and<br>danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget whether<br>they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted<br>in.<br><br>As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not<br>exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that<br>she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.<br><br>"Hullo, Wendy, good-bye," he said.<br><br>"Oh dear, are you going away?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You don't feel, Peter," she said falteringly, "that you would like to<br>say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"About me, Peter?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp<br>eye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,<br>and would like to adopt him also.<br><br>"Would you send me to school?" he inquired craftily.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And then to an office?"<br><br>"I suppose so."<br><br>"Soon I would be a man?"<br><br>"Very soon."<br><br>"I don't want to go to school and learn solemn things," he told her<br>passionately. "I don't want to be a man. O Wendy's mother, if I was to<br>wake up and feel there was a beard!"<br><br>"Peter," said Wendy the comforter, "I should love you in a beard;" and<br>Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.<br><br>"Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man."<br><br>"But where are you going to live?"<br><br>"With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it<br>high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights."<br><br>"How lovely," cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her<br>grip.<br><br>"I thought all the fairies were dead," Mrs. Darling said.<br><br>"There are always a lot of young ones," explained Wendy, who was now<br>quite an authority, "because you see when a new baby laughs for the<br>first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there<br>are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the<br>mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are<br>just little sillies who are not sure what they are."<br><br>"I shall have such fun," said Peter, with eye on Wendy.<br><br>"It will be rather lonely in the evening," she said, "sitting by the<br>fire."<br><br>"I shall have Tink."<br><br>"Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round," she reminded him a<br>little tartly.<br><br>"Sneaky tell-tale!" Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.<br><br>"It doesn't matter," Peter said.<br><br>"O Peter, you know it matters."<br><br>"Well, then, come with me to the little house."<br><br>"May I, mummy?"<br><br>"Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you."<br><br>"But he does so need a mother."<br><br>"So do you, my love."<br><br>"Oh, all right," Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness<br>merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this<br>handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do<br>his spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent<br>arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;<br>but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of<br>time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him<br>is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew<br>this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:<br><br>"You won't forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time<br>comes?"<br><br>Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling's<br>kiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite<br>easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.<br><br>Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class<br>III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.<br>Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they<br>saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was too<br>late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me<br>or Jenkins minor [the younger Jenkins]. It is sad to have to say that<br>the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to<br>the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of<br>their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the English<br>double-deckers]; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed,<br>and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus. In time<br>they could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called<br>it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.<br><br>Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;<br>so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first<br>year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves<br>and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice<br>how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say<br>about himself.<br><br>She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but<br>new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.<br><br>"Who is Captain Hook?" he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch<br>enemy.<br><br>"Don't you remember," she asked, amazed, "how you killed him and saved<br>all our lives?"<br><br>"I forget them after I kill them," he replied carelessly.<br><br>When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see<br>her he said, "Who is Tinker Bell?"<br><br>"O Peter," she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not<br>remember.<br><br>"There are such a lot of them," he said. "I expect she is no more."<br><br>I expect he was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are so<br>little that a short time seems a good while to them.<br><br>Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday<br>to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was<br>exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in<br>the little house on the tree tops.<br><br>Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the<br>old one simply would not meet; but he never came.<br><br>"Perhaps he is ill," Michael said.<br><br>"You know he is never ill."<br><br>Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, "Perhaps there<br>is no such person, Wendy!" and then Wendy would have cried if Michael<br>had not been crying.<br><br>Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never<br>knew he had missed a year.<br><br>That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer<br>she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was<br>untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years<br>came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again<br>Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a little<br>dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You<br>need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow<br>up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other<br>girls.<br><br>All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely<br>worth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and<br>Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag<br>and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver [train engineer]. Slightly<br>married a lady of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in<br>a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded<br>man who doesn't know any story to tell his children was once John.<br><br>Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think<br>that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [formal<br>announcement of a marriage].<br><br>Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be<br>written in ink but in a golden splash.<br><br>She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from<br>the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When<br>she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She<br>loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the<br>very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was<br>Jane's nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per cents<br>[mortgage rate] from Wendy's father, who was no longer fond of stairs.<br>Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.<br><br>There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her nurse's; and<br>there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old age,<br>and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very<br>firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except<br>herself.<br><br>Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy's<br>part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane's<br>invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own, thus<br>making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:<br><br>"What do we see now?"<br><br>"I don't think I see anything to-night," says Wendy, with a feeling that<br>if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.<br><br>"Yes, you do," says Jane, "you see when you were a little girl."<br><br>"That is a long time ago, sweetheart," says Wendy. "Ah me, how time<br>flies!"<br><br>"Does it fly," asks the artful child, "the way you flew when you were a<br>little girl?"<br><br>"The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever<br>did really fly."<br><br>"Yes, you did."<br><br>"The dear old days when I could fly!"<br><br>"Why can't you fly now, mother?"<br><br>"Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the<br>way."<br><br>"Why do they forget the way?"<br><br>"Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only<br>the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly."<br><br>"What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and<br>innocent and heartless."<br><br>Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.<br><br>"I do believe," she says, "that it is this nursery."<br><br>"I do believe it is," says Jane. "Go on."<br><br>They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter<br>flew in looking for his shadow.<br><br>"The foolish fellow," says Wendy, "tried to stick it on with soap, and<br>when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for<br>him."<br><br>"You have missed a bit," interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better<br>than her mother. "When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did<br>you say?"<br><br>"I sat up in bed and I said, 'Boy, why are you crying?'"<br><br>"Yes, that was it," says Jane, with a big breath.<br><br>"And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the<br>pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon, and the home under<br>the ground, and the little house."<br><br>"Yes! which did you like best of all?"<br><br>"I think I liked the home under the ground best of all."<br><br>"Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?"<br><br>"The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting for me,<br>and then some night you will hear me crowing.'"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"But, alas, he forgot all about me," Wendy said it with a smile. She was<br>as grown up as that.<br><br>"What did his crow sound like?" Jane asked one evening.<br><br>"It was like this," Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter's crow.<br><br>"No, it wasn't," Jane said gravely, "it was like this;" and she did it<br>ever so much better than her mother.<br><br>Wendy was a little startled. "My darling, how can you know?"<br><br>"I often hear it when I am sleeping," Jane said.<br><br>"Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only<br>one who heard it awake."<br><br>"Lucky you," said Jane.<br><br>And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and<br>the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her<br>bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to<br>see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she<br>sat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and<br>Peter dropped in on the floor.<br><br>He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had<br>all his first teeth.<br><br>He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not<br>daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.<br><br>"Hullo, Wendy," he said, not noticing any difference, for he was<br>thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might<br>have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.<br><br>"Hullo, Peter," she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as<br>possible. Something inside her was crying "Woman, Woman, let go of me."<br><br>"Hullo, where is John?" he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.<br><br>"John is not here now," she gasped.<br><br>"Is Michael asleep?" he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.<br><br>"Yes," she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as<br>well as to Peter.<br><br>"That is not Michael," she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on<br>her.<br><br>Peter looked. "Hullo, is it a new one?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Boy or girl?"<br><br>"Girl."<br><br>Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.<br><br>"Peter," she said, faltering, "are you expecting me to fly away with<br>you?"<br><br>"Of course; that is why I have come." He added a little sternly, "Have<br>you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"<br><br>She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning<br>times pass.<br><br>"I can't come," she said apologetically, "I have forgotten how to fly."<br><br>"I'll soon teach you again."<br><br>"O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me."<br><br>She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. "What is it?" he<br>cried, shrinking.<br><br>"I will turn up the light," she said, "and then you can see for<br>yourself."<br><br>For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.<br>"Don't turn up the light," he cried.<br><br>She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a<br>little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it<br>all, but they were wet eyed smiles.<br><br>Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and<br>when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew<br>back sharply.<br><br>"What is it?" he cried again.<br><br>She had to tell him.<br><br>"I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long<br>ago."<br><br>"You promised not to!"<br><br>"I couldn't help it. I am a married woman, Peter."<br><br>"No, you're not."<br><br>"Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby."<br><br>"No, she's not."<br><br>But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child<br>with his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on<br>the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him,<br>though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman now,<br>and she ran out of the room to try to think.<br><br>Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,<br>and was interested at once.<br><br>"Boy," she said, "why are you crying?"<br><br>Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.<br><br>"Hullo," he said.<br><br>"Hullo," said Jane.<br><br>"My name is Peter Pan," he told her.<br><br>"Yes, I know."<br><br>"I came back for my mother," he explained, "to take her to the<br>Neverland."<br><br>"Yes, I know," Jane said, "I have been waiting for you."<br><br>When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post<br>crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room<br>in solemn ecstasy.<br><br>"She is my mother," Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his<br>side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they<br>gazed at him.<br><br>"He does so need a mother," Jane said.<br><br>"Yes, I know." Wendy admitted rather forlornly; "no one knows it so well<br>as I."<br><br>"Good-bye," said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the<br>shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving<br>about.<br><br>Wendy rushed to the window.<br><br>"No, no," she cried.<br><br>"It is just for spring cleaning time," Jane said, "he wants me always to<br>do his spring cleaning."<br><br>"If only I could go with you," Wendy sighed.<br><br>"You see you can't fly," said Jane.<br><br>Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse<br>of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky<br>until they were as small as stars.<br><br>As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her<br>figure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a<br>common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring<br>cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and<br>takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,<br>to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a<br>daughter, who is to be Peter's mother in turn; and thus it will go on,<br>so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.<br><br><br>THE END<br><br><br><br><br><br>End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Peter Pan, by James M.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br>Literary Archive Foundation<br><br>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations<br>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br>status with the IRS.<br><br>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations<br>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To<br>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any<br>particular state visit http://pglaf.org<br><br>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br>approach us with offers to donate.<br><br>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br><br>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other<br>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.<br>To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate<br><br><br>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br>works.<br><br>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm<br>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared<br>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project<br>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.<br><br>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.<br><br>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's<br>eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,<br>compressed (zipped), HTML and others.<br><br>Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over<br>the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.<br>VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving<br>new filenames and etext numbers.<br><br>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:<br><br>http://www.gutenberg.org<br><br>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br><br>EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,<br>are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to<br>download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular<br>search system you may utilize the following addresses and just<br>download by the etext year.<br><br>http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06<br><br>    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,<br>     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)<br><br>EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are<br>filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part<br>of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is<br>identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single<br>digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For<br>example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:<br><br>http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234<br><br>or filename 24689 would be found at:<br>http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689<br><br>An alternative method of locating eBooks:<br>http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL<br><br>*** END: FULL LICENSE ***<br>
